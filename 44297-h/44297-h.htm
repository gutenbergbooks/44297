<h2>THE EVOLUTION OF COLONIES.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By JAMES COLLIER.</span></p>


<h3>VII.&mdash;SOCIAL EVOLUTION.</h3>

<p>Perhaps there is no civilized institution to which, man has accommodated
himself with so ill a grace as monogamy. Hardly
a perversion of it has ever existed but may still be found. Polygamy
is widely spread in the most advanced communities; temporary polyandrous
<i>m&eacute;nages &agrave; trois</i> are known to exist elsewhere than among
the Nairs and Tibetans and <i>ancient</i> Britons; the matriarchate in one
shape or another may be detected well outside the sixty peoples
among whom Mr. Tylor has discovered it; and marriage by free
choice is far from having superseded marriage by capture or by purchase.
It is the less surprising that abnormal or ancient forms of
the union should have been revived in colonies. In this relationship,
as in most others, the colonist, like the sperm cell after its junction
with the germ cell, sinks at once to a lower level, and the race has to
begin life over again. The fall is inevitable. The earliest immigrants
are all of them men. Everywhere finding indigenes in the
newly settled country, they can usually count on the complaisance
or the submissiveness of the tribesmen. Native women have a strange
fascination for civilized men, even for those who have been intimate
with the European aristocracies and have belonged to them. Adventurous
Castins might find their account in a relationship that was
in perfect keeping with the wild life they led. It is more strange
that, enslaved by an appetite which sometimes rose to a collective
if seldom to a personal passion, educated men, with a scientific or a
public career flung open to them at their option, able men who have
written the best books about the races they knew only too well, men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
of great position whose heroic deeds and winning manners made
them adored by women of their own race, should have spoiled their
prime, or inextricably entangled themselves, or wrecked their own
roof-tree and incurred lifelong desertion by the wife of their youth.
The bluest blood of Spain was not contaminated by an alliance with
the Incas, but just ten years ago the direct line of an ancient English
earldom was extinguished among the Kaffirs. The truth seems to
be that while a woman will not as a rule accept a man who is her
inferior in rank or refinement, a man easily contents himself for the
time with almost any female. The Bantu woman and the Australian
<i>zubra</i> are not alluring, but they have never lacked suitors. Colonial
women shrink (or profess to shrink) from the Chinaman; all colors&mdash;black,
brown, red, and yellow&mdash;seem to be alike to the undiscriminating
male appetite. Yet it has its preferences. The high official who
stands unmoved before the cloudy attractions of the Zulu, surrenders
at discretion to the soft-voiced, dark-eyed, plump-limbed daughters of
Maoriland. In the last case a perverse theory (of the future amalgamation
of the races) may have been "the light that led astray";
it certainly was used to justify their acts to the consciences of the
doers. Romance had its share: Browning's Waring (who was premier
as well as poet) threw a poetic glamour over the miscegenation,
as another minister found in the race the Ossianesque attributes
of his own Highlanders. It sometimes, even now, rises into passion:
the colonial schoolmaster who marries a native girl will declare that
his is a love match. But the chief reason at all times was "the
custom of the country." "It was the regular thing," remarked an
old legislator, looking ruefully back on his past. Nor is it to be
harshly censured. Corresponding to the Roman slave-concubinage
which Cato Major did not disdain to practice, it repeated a stage in
the history of the mother country when the invading Angles allied
themselves (as anthropology abundantly proves) with the native
Britons. While making a kind of atonement to the indigenes, it was
a solatium to the pioneer colonists for a life of hardship and privation.</p>

<p>A higher grade was the concubinage of convictism, which was
with women of the same race and was capable of rising into normal
marriage. In the early days of New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land it seems to have been almost universal, and it lasted for many
years. Not one in ten of the officials lived with his legally married
wife. In the latter colony it was suppressed by the governor, who
ordered them to marry the women by whom they had families. In
the former, if Dr. Lang's account of his exertions is accepted, it was
put down by the exposure of guilty parties. It was accompanied by
other features of a low social state. The public and private sale of
wives was not infrequent. The colonial equivalent for a wife, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
currency of those days, was sometimes four gallons of rum, or five
pounds sterling and a gallon, or twenty sheep and a gallon; one
woman was sold for fifty sheep.</p>

<p>Around gold and silver mining encampments nondescript relationships
of a slightly higher order arise. They are with free women,
though the women are apt to be of the same class as Bret Harte's
Duchess of Poker Flat, answering to the Doll Tearsheets of hardly
more civilized communities. They often issue in marriage. In mining
townships, and even in colonial towns, professional men are to
be found married to unpresentable women.</p>

<p>In colonies of regular foundation normal marriages are contracted
under difficulties. Few women at first go out, the emigrants
intending to return when they have made their fortune. Women
have accordingly to be sent. In the seventeenth century a number
of girls of good repute were persuaded to emigrate to Virginia, a
subscription being raised to defray the cost. In the following century
wives were sent to settlers in French Louisiana on the same plan.
To French Canada women were dispatched by shiploads. They were
selected (according to Parkman) as butchers choose cattle: the
plumpest were preferred, because they could stand the winter best
and would stay at home. In Virginia women were offered for sale
to eager colonists, who willingly paid one hundred pounds of tobacco
for one, or as much as one hundred and fifty pounds for a very pretty
girl; a debt incurred for the purchase of a wife being considered a
debt of honor. In the early days of Canterbury, New Zealand, when
a consignment of servant girls arrived, young farmers would ride
over the Port hills and carry them off, though in the style rather of
young Lochinvar than of the Sabine rape. Settlers have often requested
the agent general for the colony or the mayor of their native
town to send them out a wife. Wives so easily acquired are apt to
be lightly parted with, and within the last few years, in colonial
villages, amicable exchanges have been effected&mdash;one woman going
with her children to the house of another man, whose wife and children
made a reciprocal migration. Facts such as these (which might
readily be multiplied) show how easily so-called civilized man sloughs
off the conventions of ages and sinks to a primitive level. They soon
disappear, however, and social colonial conditions rapidly assimilate
themselves to those of the mother country. In most young colonies
marriage is universal and it is early. After a few days' acquaintance
couples rashly engage themselves, in utter ignorance of one another's
character or of their own, and a precipitate marriage follows, with
such results as might be expected. Statistics show that the age of
marriage on the part of women is steadily rising. In the early days
of each colony a girl was deemed <i>pass&eacute;e</i> if she did not get married before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
she was twenty-one. In the decade that ended the first century
of New South Wales the proportion of married women under that
age fell from 28.17 to 23.55 per cent; in less prosperous Victoria,
after only half a century, it fell from 21 to 17.4; in New Zealand
there was a big drop from 29.4 to 19.7. The proportion of
married women under twenty-five has also seriously declined. The
decrease is noticeably correspondent with the increased number of
young women who are gaining their own livelihood&mdash;largely as
teachers and typewriters. On these lines the colonies are following
the lead of the mother country. Long engagements, followed by late
marriages with fewer children, take the place of short engagements
with hasty marriages and larger families. Female celibacy is no
longer dishonorable, and women are beginning to understand that
they may be far happier single and self-supporting. The quality of
marriage improves with its rarity. When an Australian M. A.
marries an M. A., or the most brilliant of New Zealand professors
marries one of his most distinguished students, we feel, as when a
Dilke marries a Pattison, that the ideal of the union has been realized.</p>

<p>The growth of the colonial house follows the development of the
family and repeats the history of the race. The immigrant procures
his abode, as he afterward buys his clothes, ready made. The ancient
troglodyte lives to-day in the Derbyshire cave dweller; the
original Romanist settlers of Maryland were driven to take refuge in
cave houses in Virginia; and the New Zealand hermit, like "great
P&aelig;an's son" at Lemnos, "weeps o'er his wound" of the heart in a
cave by the resounding sea. Where they can not be found ready dug
they can be excavated, as they were by some early Pennsylvania
colonists. Others in Virginia, New York, and New England found
it easier to dig holes in the ground, thus imitating the Germans of
Tacitus, whose winter residences are also repeated in those basements
which form the wholesome abode of the London domestic servant.
The wattle-and-daub house of the Anglo-Saxon villager has been
everywhere reproduced in the colonies, and may still be abundantly
found.</p>

<p>If the occupation of caves and the burrowing of holes suggests
man's distant affinity to the carnivora and lower quadrupeds, his
simian origin is confirmed by the use he makes of the tree. In the
infant city of Philadelphia there were "few mansions but hollow
trees." A rude form of tent is the next stage, the canvas consisting
(as may still be seen among the poorer campers-out) of clothes or
rags. Then, as in the early days of Sydney, the tents were covered
in with bushes and thatched over. Next (as may to-day be observed
in the neighborhood of Coolgardie) a framework of branches is employed
to support the canvas, and the tent is converted into a cabin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
A stride toward the house is taken when the branches are replaced
by a regular woodwork, with doors and windows; the envelope being
still sometimes canvas, which is soon replaced by corrugated iron.
The Brazilian country house where Darwin lodged sixty years ago
was built of upright posts with interwoven boughs. Another line
of development starts from the trunk of the tree. The early
American colonists made bark wigwams. The Australian pastoralist
"erected a temporary house, generally of large sheets of bark, in
the first instance." In countries where the winter is more severe or
the bark less substantial, the backwoodsman builds, as the early
colonist built, a rude cabin of round logs. Then the logs are hewn,
or they are split or sawn into planks, and built into the weatherboard
houses still common in the rural parts of Australia, and general even
in New Zealand towns. In their earliest stages they are still without
a floor and are roofed with thatch or shingle. Towns often thus remain
like early Sydney, "a mere assemblage of paltry erections intermediate
between the hut and the house." The architecture is of
the simplest. A "butt" and a "ben," with a "lean-to," form the
prevailing type. As the family grows or its wealth increases, new
portions are added, till many colonial houses look for all the world
as if they had "come out in penny numbers." Even with a few
stately structures&mdash;luxurious mansions, extensive government offices,
Gothic parliamentary buildings&mdash;a wooden city has an indefinable
meanness of appearance. It is improved out of existence by the dread
agency of fire. Like Charles's London, New Orleans and many
another colonial town have thus had an Augustan renewal. Houses
are now built of brick, stone, or concrete; tile, slate, and iron replaced
thatch and shingle; two stories were ventured on; chimneys
were smaller but safer. They became susceptible of architecture:
Spanish features were introduced into those of New Orleans; the
more northern colonies copied the English country house, with modifications
to suit the hotter or colder climate; and in New South Wales
a taste for mansion-building came into vogue along with splendid
equipages, liveried servants, and pedigrees. Such houses were at first
arranged in all degrees of irregularity and confusion. The street is a
modern invention. The cows returning from pasture laid out Boston,
and the bullock teams climbing up from the harbor charted
Sydney. Towns in manufactured colonies, as Savannah, Augusta,
most South American cities, Christchurch and Invercargill in New
Zealand, were planned before settlement and have their streets at
right angles.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago Talleyrand, exiled in the United States, described
the journey from one of these cities to the interior as successively
exhibiting all past stages of the human habitation from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
mansion to the tent, and just a century later one of Talleyrand's
countrymen, M. Pierre Leroy-Beaulieu, traveling in the reverse
direction, from "the bush" to Coolgardie, witnessed the gradual
transformation of the tent into the two-storied hotel. A great part of
the history of the race in the matter of habitations is thus museumed
in the space of a few miles.</p>

<p>If the temple rises out of the tomb, is modeled on that, and remains
to the last pre-eminently a place of sacrifice, the church is an
enlarged dwelling house. It is the house of the god, as the fetichist
called it&mdash;the house of God, as we still reverently call it; and in
Romanist countries to this day it is in a manner the abode of two
divine personages, who figure as dizened and painted dolls that are
named respectively God and the Mother of God! Both lines of development
are rapidly recapitulated in colonies. The temple appears
as the cathedral, which has modest beginnings, but gradually assumes
the architecture and proportions of Gothic cathedrals, losing relation
to the primary wants of the worshipers&mdash;comfort and audibility&mdash;ministering
mainly to their higher needs, and if used for preaching
at all, reserved for such occasional and sensational pulpit oratory as
that of Dominican monks like Lacordaire at Notre Dame in Paris,
or of a Protestant Dominican like the late Canon Liddon at St.
Paul's in London. The church, chapel, or meeting house may be
found in colonial villages in its most rudimentary form, scarcely
distinguishable in style from a dwelling house. According to the
sect it belongs to, it develops in one of two opposite directions. The
age of cathedrals is past, even in Roman Catholic countries, but the
tendency of Anglican and allied churches is to simulate the old
cathedral; high ritualistic sections mimic the gorgeous Madeleine.
The more liberal denominations, on the other hand, develop downward;
the colonial Baptist tabernacle is on the lines of Spurgeon's
great building at Newington, but the ancient pulpit is widened into
a platform and the seats slope upward as in a concert hall; it is a
mere auditorium, in which the preacher is all. The development in
this direction finds its extreme in the secularist hall, which is a mere
concert room, with a piano in place of an organ. The ceremonial
development is on the same lines&mdash;toward the gradual adoption of
ancient rites by the older churches, toward more freedom in the
younger sects. Many a colonial clergyman has wrecked himself or
his congregation through too much ritualism; a few have injured
themselves through an excess of liberalism.</p>

<p>A parallel evolution takes place in church government. Where
an organized settlement is made on political principles, congregations
carry their minister with them, or rather the ministers carry their
congregations. Where the colony is normally founded and grows up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
as the mother country grew, the first ministers, like the first preachers
of Christianity itself, are often laymen. In an interior county of
Virginia Morris read every Lord's day to his neighbors from the
writings of Luther and Bunyan, and a meeting house was at length
built for him; it is a typical instance of the beginnings of most
churches. The part of laymen remains long prominent in colonies.
The Anglican lay reader is everywhere a feature of colonial church
life. In the more flexible churches a storekeeper or retired sea captain
will read Spurgeon's sermons or preach excellent sermons of his
own in an Otago village or the Australian bush. Where missionaries
have been sent out to convert the heathen in a country afterward
colonized, many of them remain as ministers, as did Augustin
and his monks in England. The Presbyterian catechist likewise becomes
a settled minister. Others arrive. Men of independent character,
like Dr. Lang, of Sydney, resolve not to wait for any dead
man's shoes in the kirk, but sail beyond the seas to colonies where
there is no minister of their own denomination. Heretics, incompatibles,
men who have failed, men whose health has given way,
emigrate in increasing numbers. Still, the supply is long deficient.
Clergymen were scarce in New York. A bounty was offered to
immigrants in Virginia. Six years after the establishment of the
Church of England in North Carolina there was only one clergyman
in the country. The few there are repeat the history of the first
Christian bishops and the early English monks in serving a circuit of
two, three, or more churches. The state comes to the rescue by providing
for their support. In England contributions were at first
voluntary; by the eighth century tithes were levied, folk-land was
granted, and private endowments were made. Just so was the
Church of England established and endowed in New York, Virginia,
and North Carolina; in Maryland a poll tax of forty pounds of tobacco
was levied for its support. In Connecticut and Massachusetts
a church was set up in each parish on Congregationalist principles
by a vote of the people, who elected the minister and voted his
salary. So uncertain was the tenure that in several States even the
Anglican minister was hired from year to year; and quite lately an
Anglican church in a British colony engaged its incumbent, as it
might have engaged its organist, for a term. In 1791 the Church
of England in Canada was partially established, and its clergy endowed
with grants of land. The Australasian colonies have pursued
a very various policy. By the Constitution Act of 1791 one seventh
of the ungranted lands in New South Wales was set apart for the
support of a Protestant clergy. An attempt to endow the Anglican
Church in South Australia in the early forties was defeated by a
radical governor. A recrudescence of the ecclesiastical principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
permitted the church settlements of Otago and Canterbury in New
Zealand to appropriate a portion of the funds derived from the sale
of lands for the endowment of the Presbyterian and Anglican
churches respectively. So far the colonies followed, latterly with
halting steps, the history of the mother country. As in political, so
in ecclesiastical government, they have anticipated that history. The
American state churches did not survive the Revolution. In Canada
the Presbyterians and other sects successfully asserted their
claims to a share in the church endowments, which between 1840
and 1853 were distributed among the municipalities, all semblance
of a connection between church and state being thus destroyed.
New South Wales passed through a period of religious equality with
concurrent endowment of the four most numerous denominations,
and a long struggle against the principle of establishment was ended
in 1879, when the reserves were devoted to the purposes of education.
The practice of confiscating for the church a portion of the proceeds
of the land sales was gradually dropped in Otago and Canterbury,
probably more for commercial reasons than in consequence of the opposition
of the democratic governor aforesaid, who spoked the wheel
of the South Australians. Yielding to Nonconformist pressure, the
liberal Government in 1869 enforced the principle of religious equality
throughout the crown colonies, which were thus, willingly or
not, made to follow the lead of the movement in Ireland. The internal
organization of the colonial church is also anticipative. Fifty-two
years ago Sir George Grey bestowed on the Anglican Church in
New Zealand, then governed by him, a constitution modeled on
that of the corresponding church in the United States, as the political
constitution he drafted for the colony was modeled on the Constitution
of the United States; and it has been imitated in other Australasian
colonies, which have thus declared themselves independent of
the mother church, while the colony is still politically dependent on
the mother country. In yet another point the daughters have outstripped
the parent. Three Presbyterian denominations still fissure
the old home of Presbyterianism; only two have ever existed in the
colonies, and for thirty years these two have been one. The four
chief Methodist sects in Australia are also said to be on the point of
amalgamating.</p>

<p>The development of doctrine runs a fourth parallel to those of
buildings, cult, and organization, and in a brief space it recapitulates
a long history. In early colonial communities religious dogma is
found in a state of "albuminous simplicity." "A healthy man,"
says Thoreau, "with steady employment, as wood-chopping at fifty
cents a cord, and a camp in the woods, will not be a good subject
for Christianity." Nor will a bush-faller, at twenty-five shillings the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
acre. Distant from a church and a minister, he gets out of the way
of attending the rare services brought within his reach, and forgets
the religion in which he was nurtured. It does not mingle with his
life. He is usually married at a registrar's. His children are unbaptized.
His parents die unshriven. The dull crises of his mean
existence come and go, and religion stands dumb before them. The
inner spiritual realities fade from his view as their outward symbols
disappear, and bit by bit the whole theological vesture woven by
nineteen Christian centuries drops off him like Rip Van Winkle's
rotten garments when he woke from his long sleep. In the matter
of religion, as in almost all else, the colonist has to begin life again
poor.</p>

<p>As population grows and people come nearer to one another, two
things happen. The churches push their skirmishers into the interior,
plant stations, and have regular services. Gradually the old
doctrines strike root in the new soil, and at length a creed answering
to Evangelicalism is commonly held, thus repeating the first stage in
the history of Christianity in Asia as in England. On the other
hand, many of those whom neglect had softened into indifference
or hardened into contempt assume a more decided attitude. With
the spirit of independence which colonial life so readily begets, and
stimulated by the skeptical literature of the day, they take ground
against the renascent religion. Secularism, which denies what Evangelicalism
affirms and is on a level with that, is born. It organizes
itself, has halls and Sunday meetings, catechisms and children's
teaching, newspapers, and a propaganda. For a while it is triumphant,
openly contemptuous of the current religious mythology, and
menacing toward its exponents. The Secularist leaders make their
way to the bench and the legislature, the cabinet and the premiership.
It is here the hitch arises. Some (by no means all) of these
leaders are found to prefer power to principle, and prudently let their
secularism go by the board when a wave of popular odium threatens
to swamp the ship. Financial distress spreads. The movement loses
<i>&eacute;clat</i>. As Bradlaugh's Hall of Science in London has been sold to
the Salvation Army, the Freethought Hall in Sydney has been purchased
by the Methodists, and in other colonial towns the cause has
collapsed. But it always remains, whether patent or latent, as a
needed counterpoise to the crudities of Evangelicalism, and it is the
core of that increasing mass of religious indifferentism which strikes
those who have been brought up in the old country. Statistics are
said to prove that Australia is more addicted to church-going than
England. If they prove any such thing, then statistics (as Mr. Bumble
irreverently said of the British Constitution) are hasses and hidiots.
You may sit down on any Sunday morning at a colonial table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
with a dozen highly respectable persons of both sexes and all ages,
not one of whom has any thought of going to church that day. Such
an experience would be impossible in England. The mistake has
arisen from comparing England as a whole, which has classes below
the line of church-going or indeed of civilization, with Australia as a
whole, where such classes hardly exist. Compare Australia in this
respect with the English middle classes, and the fallacy will be
manifest.</p>

<p>When a colony has hived off from the parent state at a time of
religious excitement, and especially when it has religion for its <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</i>, it starts fully equipped on lines of its own, the earlier naturalistic
stages being dropped. English theology and Puritan religion
emigrated to North America in the seventeenth century, and there
for two centuries they for the most part remained. Ever since, in
New England and the States of the middle belt, religion has played
the same high part as it did in old England under Oliver. There
has, therefore, been a theological development in the United States
to which, till fifty years ago, there was no antecedent parallel in the
mother country. While it has produced no theologian or pulpit
orator of the first rank&mdash;no Calvin, but only Jonathan Edwards; no
Bossuet or Chalmers, but only Channing and Beecher&mdash;its theological
literature compares favorably with that of England during the
same period, and its preachers are acknowledged to be the best in
Christendom. States and colonies that have grown up more normally
get at length on the same lines, and as they put on civilization
the tendency is to adopt ever more of the dogmatic system long inseparable
from it. By a well-understood sociological law it generates
its contradictory and corrective, and there springs up a higher type
of denial than secularism&mdash;what Huxley felicitously named Agnosticism&mdash;the
position of those who know nothing about the matters
which theological dogma defines, not the position of those who say
that nothing can be known. As the Evangelical develops into the
High Churchman and he into the Catholic, the Secularist refines into
the Agnostic and rarefies into the Unknowabilist.</p>

<p>The literature of colonies is at first theological, as the literature
of all countries is at first hieratic; the priest alone can write. But
it is long before the stage of original production is reached, and books
have to be imported before they can be written. The daughter must
go to school with the mother, who supplies her with hornbooks.
The continuity of the spiritual germ-plasm is insured by the transmission
of books. Rome was thus initiated by Greece in every
theoretical branch of knowledge. Rome thus educated early Europe.
Chests of manuscripts from Thessalonica, Byzantium, and Crete
were the precursors of the Renaissance. Books brought by Benedict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
to England formed the first English library. So is it long with all
new countries. To this day the book circulation of the United States
is largely English; in contemporary colonies it is overwhelmingly
English, almost wholly Spanish, exclusively French or Dutch. The
second stage also repeats the literary history of the mother countries.
Colonial literature is a prolongation of the parental literature and is
at first commentative and imitative of that. In a school at Canterbury
founded by two foreign monks English written literature took
its birth. The literature of medi&aelig;val Europe was a continuation of
Roman literature. This stage may last long. Seventy or eighty
years after the Declaration of Independence the literature of New
England was still English literature of a subtler strain&mdash;perhaps lacking
the strength of the old home-brew, but with a finer flavor.
Naturally, in far younger Australia even popular poetry is still imitative&mdash;the
hand is that of Gordon or of Kendall, but the voice is
Swinburne's. The beginnings of a truly national literature are
humble. They are never scholastic, but always popular. As chap-books,
ballads, and songs were the sources of the &aelig;sthetic literature
of modern Europe, the beginnings of general literature in the United
States have been traced to the old almanacs which, besides medical
recipes and advice to the farmer, contained some of the best productions
of American authors. It is further evidence of the popular
origin of native literature that some of its early specimens are works
of humor. The most distinctive work of early Canadian and American
authors is humorous, from Sam Slick to &mdash;&mdash;; but it would be
rash to say <i>who</i> is the last avatar of the genius of humor. If an alien
may say so without offense, Walt Whitman's poems, with their profound
intuitions and artless metre, seem to be the start of a new
&aelig;sthetic, and recall ancient Beowulf. Australian literature, after a
much shorter apprenticeship, has lately, in both fiction and verse,
again of a popular character, made a new departure that is instinct
with life and grace and full of promise.</p>

<p>Literature and art have no independent value, but are merely
the phonographic record of mental states, and would practically cease
to exist (as they did during the middle ages) if these disappeared.
The grand achievement of new, as of old, countries is man-making,
and every colony creates a new variety. The chief agent is natural
selection, of which the seamy side appears in vicissitudes of fortune.
Here again the law prevails. These recapitulate those vicissitudes in
early European societies which make picturesque the pages of Gregory
of Tours. There are the same sudden rises, giddy prosperities,
and inevitable falls. In the simple communities of ancient Greece
the distance between antecedent and consequent was short, and the
course of causation plain. Hence in myth and legend, in early historians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
like Herodotus, early poets like Pindar, early dramatists like
&AElig;schylus, we find a deep sense of the fateful working of the laws of
life. The history of colonies is a sermon on the same text. Goodness
is speedily rewarded; retribution no longer limps <i>claudo pede</i>, like
Vulcan, but flies like Mercury with winged feet. In Europe a high-handed
wrongdoer like Napoleon may pursue his career unchecked
for fifteen years, or a high-handed rightdoer like Bismarck for five-and-twenty
years; a would-be colonial Bismarck or Napoleon is commonly
laid by the heels in the short duration of a colonial parliament.
The vision of providential government, or the reign of law, in old
countries is hard, because its course is long and intricate; in a colony
it is so comparatively simple that all may understand it and find it
(as Carlyle found it) "worthy of horror and worship." From witnessing
the ending of a world Augustine constructed a theodicy, and
so justified the ways of God to man. We may discover in the beginnings
of a world materials for a cosmodicy which shall exhibit the
self-operating justice inherent in the laws of the universe.</p>

<h2>POLITICS AS A FORM OF CIVIL WAR.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By FRANKLIN SMITH.</span></p>


<p>Why is it that, in spite of exhortation and execration, the disinclination
of people in all the great democracies of the
world to take part in politics is becoming greater and greater? Why
is it that persons of fine character, scholarly tastes, and noble aims,
in particular, seek in other ways than association and co-operation
with politicians to better the lot of their fellows? Why is it, finally,
that with the enormous extension of political rights and privileges
during the past fifty years, there has occurred a social, political, and
industrial degeneration that fills with alarm the thoughtful minds of
all countries? Aside from the demoralization due to the destructive
wars fought since the Crimean, the answer to these questions is to
be found in the fact that at bottom politics is a form of civil
war, that politicians are a species of <i>condottieri</i>, and that to both
may be traced all the ethics and evils of a state of chronic war itself.
In the light of this truth, never so glaring as at present in the United
States, the peril to civilization is divested of mystery; it is the peril
that always flows from anarchy, and the refusal of enlightened men
to-day to engage in politics is as natural as the refusal of enlightened
men in other days to become brigands.</p>

<p>The analogy between war and politics is not new. The very language
in common use implies it. When people speak of "leaders,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
"rank and file," "party loyalty," "campaigns," "spoils of victory,"
etc., which figure so conspicuously and incessantly in political discussion,
there is only a fit appropriation of the militant terms invented
by one set of fighters to describe with vividness and precision the
conduct of another set. What is new about the matter is the failure
of thoughtful persons to perceive and to act upon their perception
that in politics, as in war, vast economic, social, and political evils are
involved. To be sure, lives are not often sacrificed, as in a battle, nor
property destroyed, as in a siege or an invasion. But even here the
analogy is not imperfect. Political riots have occurred that have
brought out as completely as any struggle over a redoubt or barricade
the savage traits of human nature. People were maimed and killed,
and houses wrecked and burned. Especially was that the case in this
country during the antislavery struggle and the period of reconstruction.
Even in these days of more calm, political contests as fatal as
the Ross-Shea <i>&eacute;meute</i> in Troy are reported from time to time.
Owing, however, to the advance in civilization since the sack of Antwerp
and the siege of Saragossa, the devastation wrought by political
warfare has assumed forms less deplorable. But in the long run
they will be found to be just as fatal to everything that constitutes
civilization, and just as productive of everything that constitutes
barbarism. "Lawless ruffianism," says Carl Schurz, pointing out in
his Life of Henry Clay the demoralizing effects of the fierce political
struggles during Jackson's administrations, "has perhaps never been
so rampant in this country as in those days. 'Many of the people of
the United States are out of joint,' wrote Niles in August, 1835. 'A
spirit of riot and a disposition to "take the law in their own hand"
prevails in every quarter.' Mobs, riots, burnings, lynchings, shootings,
tarrings, duels, and all sorts of violent excesses, perpetrated by
all sorts of persons upon all sorts of occasions, seemed to be the order of
the day.... Alarmingly great was the number of people who appeared
to believe that they had the right to put down by force and
violence all who displeased them by act or speech or belief in politics,
or religion, or business, or in social life." It is only familiarity with
such fruits of violent political activity, only a vision impaired by preconceived
notions of the nature of politics, that blinds the public to
their existence.</p>

<p>To see why politics must be regarded as a form of civil war rather
than as a method of business, as a system of spoliation rather than
as a science to be studied in the public schools,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it is but needful to
grasp the fundamental purpose of government as generally understood.
It is not too much to say that nothing in sociology is regarded
as more indicative of an unsound mind or of a mean and selfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
disposition than the conception of government as a power designed
to prevent aggression at home and abroad. Such a conception
has been contemptuously called "the police conception." "Who
would ever fight or die for a policeman?" cried an opponent of it,
trying to reduce an adversary to ignominious silence. It was not
sufficient to reply with the counter question, "Who would not die
for justice?" and thus expose the fallacy of the crushing interrogation.
"No one," came the retort, "could care for a country that
only protected him against swindlers, robbers, and murderers. To
merit his allegiance and to fire his devotion, she must do more than
that; she must help to make his life easier, pleasanter, and nobler."
Accordingly, the Government undertakes for him a thousand duties
that it has no business with. It builds schools and asylums for him;
it protects him against disease, and, if needful, furnishes him with
physicians and medicines; it sees that he has good beef and pork,
pure milk, and sound fruit; it refuses to permit him to drink what
he pleases, though it be only the cheaper grades of tea, nor to eat
chemical substitutes for butter and cheese, except they bear authorized
marks; it transports his mails, supplies him with garden seeds,
instructs him in the care of fowls, cattle, and horses, shows him how
to build roads, and tells him what the weather will be; it insures
him not only against incompetent plumbers, barbers, undertakers,
horseshoers, accountants, and physicians, but also against the competition
of the pauper labor of foreign countries; it creates innumerable
offices and commissions to look after the management of his
affairs, particularly to stand between him and the "rapacity" of the
corporations organized to supply the necessaries of life at the lowest
cost; it builds fleets of cruisers and vast coast fortifications to
frighten away enemies that never think of assailing him, and to inspire
them with the same respect for "the flag" that he is supposed
to feel. Indeed, there is hardly a thing, except simple justice, cheap
and speedy, that it does not provide to fill him with a love of his
country, and to make him ready to immolate himself upon her altars.</p>

<p>But I can not repeat with too much emphasis that every expenditure
beyond that required to maintain order and to enforce
justice, and every limitation of freedom beyond that needful to preserve
equal freedom, is an aggression. In no wise except in method
does it differ from the aggressions of war. In war the property of
an enemy is taken or destroyed without his consent. In case of his
capture his conduct is shaped in disregard of his wishes. The seizure
of a citizen's property in the form of taxes for a purpose that he does
not approve, and the regulation of any part of his conduct not violative
of the rights of his neighbors, are precisely the same. If he
is forbidden to carry the mails and thus earn a living, his freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
is restricted. If he can patronize no letter carrier but the Government,
to which he must pay a certain rate, no matter how excessive,
he has to a degree become a slave. The same is true if he can not
employ whomever he pleases to cut his hair, or to fix his plumbing,
or to prescribe for his health. Still truer is it if he is obliged to
contribute to a system of public education which he condemns, or
to public charities which he knows to be schools of pauperism, or
to any institution or enterprise that voluntary effort does not sustain.
In whatever way the Government may pounce upon him to
force him to work for some one besides himself and to square his
conduct with notions not his own, he is still a victim of aggression,
and the aggression is none the less real and demoralizing because it is
not committed amid the roar of cannon and the groans of the dying.</p>

<p>To what extent the American people have become victims of this
kind of aggression can not be determined with precision. Still, an
idea may be had from the volume of laws enacted at every legislative
session, and the amount of money appropriated to enforce them. A
commonplace little appreciated is that every one of them, no matter
what its ostensible object, either restricts or contributes to individual
freedom. The examination of any statute-book will soon make painfully
apparent the melancholy fact that the protection of individual
freedom figures to the smallest extent in the considerations of the
wise and benevolent legislator. Of the eight hundred enactments of
the Legislature of the State of New York in 1897, for example, I
could find only fifty-eight that had this supreme object in view. If
we apply the same ratio to the work of all the legislatures of the
country, and, allowing for biennial sessions, make it cover a period
of two years&mdash;namely, 1896 and 1897&mdash;the astonishing result will
be that, of the 14,718 laws passed, all but 1,030 aim, not to the liberation
but to the enslavement of the individual. But to this restrictive
legislation must be added the thousands of acts and ordinances of
town, city, and county legislatures that are more destructive of freedom
even than the State and Federal legislation. If not more numerous,
they are certainly more minute, meddlesome, and exasperating.</p>

<p>As to the amount of plunder passing through the hands of the
modern <i>condottieri</i>, that is susceptible of an estimate much more
accurate. If we take the expenditures of all the governments of the
United States, Federal, State, municipal, county, and town, for a
similar period of two years, they reach the enormous total of two
billion dollars, equal to more than two thirds of the national debt
at the close of the civil war.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Of this sum only about one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
and twenty million dollars, or six per cent, are devoted to the legitimate
functions of government&mdash;namely, the maintenance of police
and courts&mdash;and one hundred and forty million dollars to the
support of the military establishment.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> All the rest is expenditure
that should no more be intrusted to the Government&mdash;that is, subject
to the application of political instead of business methods&mdash;than
the expenditure of a household, or a farm, or a cotton mill, or an
iron foundry. Even if it were a legitimate expenditure of the Government,
it could not be collected nor expended without injustice.
Tax laws have never been and never will be framed that will not
permit some one to escape his share of the burdens of the community;
and the heavier those burdens are, as they are constantly becoming to
an alarming degree, the more desperate will be the effort to shirk
them&mdash;the more lightly will they rest upon the dishonest and unworthy,
and the more heavily upon the honest and worthy. Moreover,
it has never been possible, and it never will be possible, to
expend money by political methods without either waste or fraud,
and most usually without both.</p>

<p>Such a volume of legislation and taxation permits of the easy detection
of the vital difference between the theory and practice of
politics. According to the text-books and professors, politics is the
science of government. In countries like the United States, where
popular institutions prevail, the purpose of its study is the discovery
and the application of the methods that shall enable all citizens,
rich and poor, to share alike in the inestimable privilege of
saying what laws they shall have, and bear in proportion to their
means the burdens it entails. Such a privilege is supposed to confer
innumerable benefits. Every one is assured of scrupulous justice.
He is made to feel profound gratitude for his happy deliverance from
the odious tyranny and discrimination of a monarchy or an aristocracy.
The participation of everybody in the important and beneficent work
of government possesses a rare educational value. It leads the ignorant
and indifferent to take a deep interest in public questions, and
to attempt, as their strength and ability allow, the promotion of the
welfare of their beloved country. Thus they escape the deplorable
fate of burial in the sordid and selfish pursuit of their own affairs, and
the consequent dwarfing of their minds and emotions. Rising to
broader views of life and duty, they become patriots, statesmen, and
philanthropists.</p>

<p>Enchanting as this picture is, one that can be found in the
speeches of every demagogue, male and female, as well as in the
works of every political philosopher of the orthodox faith, it has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
sanction in the practice of politics. As long as the greater part of
legislation and taxation has nothing whatever to do with government,
properly speaking, politics can have no kinship with any pursuit held
in esteem by men truly civilized. What it consists of may be reduced
to a desperate and disgraceful struggle between powerful organizations,
sometimes united, like the Italian <i>condottieri</i> and the Spanish
brigands, in the form of "rings," to get control of the annual collection
and distribution of one billion dollars, and to reap the benefits
that grow out of the concession of privileges. The legislation placing
this vast power in the hands of the successful combatants is only
an incident of their work. It simply enables them under the form of
law to seize the taxpayer, bind him like another Gulliver with
rules and regulations, and to take from him whatever they please to
promote their political ambition and private interests. From this
point of view it is easy to see that politics has no more kinship
with science or justice than pillage. Nor is it likely to make people
more patriotic, high-minded, and benevolent than the rapacity of
Robin Hood or Fra Diavolo.</p>

<p>However startling or repugnant may be this view, it is the only
one that furnishes an adequate explanation of the practice of government
as carried on in every democratic country in the world.
The work of private business and philanthropy, the work in which
modern democracies have come to be chiefly engaged, is not in itself
productive of the ethics and evils of war. Contrary to the common
belief, industrial competition, which is conducted by voluntary co-operation,
tends to the supremacy of excellence, moral and material.
In societies where civilization has made headway, a merchant or
manufacturer does not seek to crush rivals by misrepresenting them
or assailing them in other ways. His natural and constant aim is to
have his goods so cheap and excellent that the public will patronize
him rather than them. To be sure, the ethics of war often prevail
in industrialism. They are not, however, one of its products; they
are the fruits of militant ages and activities. But in political competition,
which is coercive, the policy pursued is precisely the reverse.
Not by proof of moral and material excellence does the
politician establish his worth. Not by the superiority of his services
or by his fidelity to obligations does he gain the esteem and patronage
of the public. It is by the infliction of injury upon his rivals. He
misrepresents them; he deceives them; he assails them in every way
within his reach. When he triumphs over them he uses his power,
not primarily for the benefit of the people whom he is supposed to
serve, but to maintain his supremacy in order to pillage them.
"Those who make war," says Machiavelli, whose famous book is a
<i>vade mecum</i> for a modern politician as well as for an unscrupulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
and a tyrannical prince, "have always and very naturally designed to
enrich themselves and impoverish the enemy. Neither is victory
sought nor conquest desirable except to strengthen themselves and
weaken the enemy."</p>

<p>In the light of this truth the organization of powerful political
parties becomes natural and inevitable. It is just as natural and inevitable
that the more numerous the duties intrusted to the State&mdash;that
is, the greater the spoil to be fought for in caucus and convention
and on the floors of legislatures&mdash;the more powerful, dangerous,
and demoralizing they are certain to be. Were these duties confined
to the maintenance of order and the enforcement of justice, it would
be an easy matter for the busiest citizen to give them the attention
they required. So simple would they be that he could understand
them, and so important that he would insist upon their proper performance.
But when they become vast and complex, including such
special and difficult work as the education of children; the care of
idiots, lunatics, and epileptics; the supervision of the liquor traffic,
the insurance business, and railroad transportation, and the regulation
of the amount of currency needed in an industrial community,
it is beyond the powers of any man, however able, to understand
them all, and, no matter how much time he may have, to look after
them as he ought. When to these duties are added the management
of agricultural stations; the inspection of all kinds of food; the extirpation
of injurious insects, noxious weeds, and contagious diseases;
the licensing of various trades and professions; the suppression of
quacks, fortune-tellers, and gamblers; the production and sale of
sterilized milk, and the multitude of other duties now intrusted to
the Government, it is no wonder that he finds himself obliged to
neglect public questions and to devote himself more closely to his
own affairs in order to meet the ever-increasing burdens of taxation.
Neither is it any wonder that there springs up a class of men to look
after the duties he neglects, and to make such work a means of
subsistence. The very law of evolution requires such a differentiation
of social functions and organs. The politician is not, therefore,
the product of his own love of spoliation solely, but of the necessities
of a vicious extension of the duties of the State. There is nothing
more abnormal or reprehensible about his existence under the
present <i>r&eacute;gime</i> than there is about the physician or lawyer where
disease and contention prevail. As long as the conditions are maintained
that created him, so long will he ply his profession. When
they are abolished he will be abolished. No number of citizens'
unions, or nonpartisan movements, or other devices of hopeful but
misguided reformers to abolish him, can modify or reverse this immutable
decree of social science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span></p>

<p>Politics tends to bring to the front the same kind of men that
other social disorders do. A study of political leaders in the democratic
societies of the world discloses portraits that differ only in
degree from those that hang in the galleries of history in Italy in
the fifteenth century, in Germany during the Thirty Years' War,
and in France at the height of the French Revolution. Although
the men they represent may not be as barbarous as Galeazzo or Wallenstein
or Robespierre, they are just as unscrupulous and despicable.
Like their prototypes, some of them are of high birth; others
are of humble origin; still others belong to the criminal class. They
do not, of course, capture cities and towns and hold them for ransom,
or threaten to burn fields of wheat and corn unless bribed to
desist; still they practice methods of spoliation not less efficient. By
blackmailing corporations and wealthy individuals, they obtain sums
of money that would have filled with bitter envy the leaders of the
famous or rather infamous "companies of adventurers." With the
booty thus obtained they gather about them numerous and powerful
bands of followers. In every district where their supremacy is
acknowledged they have their lieutenants and sublieutenants that
obey as implicitly as the subordinates in an army. Thus equipped
like any of the great brigands of history, they carry caucuses and
conventions, shape the party policy, and control the legislation proposed
and enacted.</p>

<p>To be sure, the economic devastation of politics is not as conspicuous
as that of war. It does not take the tragic form of burning
houses, trampled fields of grain, tumbling walls of cities, and vast
unproductive consumption by great bodies of armed men. Yet it
is none the less real. Not infrequently it is hardly less extensive
when measured in dollars and cents. Seldom does an election occur,
certainly not a heated congressional or presidential election, that the
complaint of serious interference with business is not universal. So
great has the evil become that, long before the meeting of the national
conventions in 1896, a concerted movement on the part of the industrial
interests of the country was started to secure an abbreviation
of the period given up to political turmoil. Even more serious is
the economic disturbance due to legislatures. As no one knows what
stupendous piece of folly they may commit at any moment, there is
constant apprehension. "The country," said the Philadelphia
Ledger, a year ago, referring to the disturbance provoked by the
Teller repudiation resolution in the Senate and the violent Cuban
debate in the House, "has got Congress on its hands, and, after their
respective fashions, Senate and House are putting enormous weight
of disturbing doubts and fears upon it.... To a greater or less degree
a meeting of Congress has been during recent years anticipated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
by the community of business with timidity which in some instances
has amounted to trepidation." The State legislatures are hardly
better. No great industry has any assurance that it will not find
itself threatened with a violent and ruinous assault in some bill that
a rapacious politician or misguided philanthropist has introduced.
In New York the attacks of these modern brigands have become so
frequent and so serious that many of the larger corporations have
had to take refuge in adjacent States,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> where they can enjoy greater,
if not complete immunity. In a less degree the same is true of the
minor legislatures&mdash;town, county, and municipal. Ordinances for
pavements or sewers or in concession of valuable privileges keep the
taxpayers in a state of constant anxiety. At the same time vast
harm comes from the neglect of more important matters. The time
of legislators is spent in intriguing and wrangling, and the millions
of dollars that the sessions cost are as completely destroyed as though
burned by invaders.</p>

<p>Though seldom or never recognized, politics has the same structural
effect upon society as war. The militant forces of the one, like
the militant forces of the other, tend to the destruction of social mobility
and the creation of social rigidity, making further social evolution
difficult or impossible. There is a repression of the spirit of individual
initiative, which calls into existence just such institutions
as may be required at any moment and permits them to pass away as
soon as they have served their purpose. There is an encouragement
of the class and parasitic spirit, which produces institutions based
upon artificial distinctions, and, like those in China, so tenacious of
life as to defy either reform or abolition. To provide place and pelf
for followers, political leaders, aided by the misdirected labors of
social reformers, favor constantly the extension of the sphere of government
in every direction. In New York, for example, during the
past eighteen years, thirty-six additions to State offices and commissions
have been made. Simultaneously, the expenditures on their
account have grown from less than four thousand dollars a year to
nearly seven million. This feudal tendency toward the bureaucracy
that exists in France and Germany, and in every country cursed with
the social structure produced by war, is not only the same in the other
States, but in the Federal Government as well. Its latest manifestation
is the amazing extension of the powers of the interstate commerce
commission demanded in the Cullom bill, and the proposed
establishment of a department of commerce to promote trade with
foreign countries. As in New York, there has been an enormous increase
in Federal expenditures. In the agricultural department it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
has been from $3,283,000 in 1887 to $23,480,000 in 1897. In
other departments the increase has ranged from nineteen per cent
in the legislative and twenty-three in the diplomatic and consular
to seventy in the Indian, seventy-seven in the post office and river
and harbor, and one hundred and thirty-three in the pension. Another
manifestation is the pressing demand for the extension of the
pension system to civil officials. Already the system has been extended
to policemen and firemen. In some States the teachers in the
public schools receive pensions, and in others the clamor for this form
of taxation is loud and persistent. At the present time a powerful
movement is in progress to pension the civil servants of the Government.
Still another manifestation is the passage of laws in revival
of the old trade and professional corporations. For a long time those
in protection of the legal and medical professions have been on the
statute-books, if not always in force. But, as always happens, these
bad precedents have been used as arguments in favor of the plumbers,
barbers, dentists, druggists, and other trades and professions. But
the most absurd manifestation is the social classification of Government
employees in accordance with the size of their salaries, a form
of folly particularly apparent in Washington, and the establishment
of patriotic and other societies, like the Sons and Daughters of the
American Revolution, the Baronial Order of Runnymede, and the
Royal Order of the Crown, that create social distinctions based, not
upon character and ability, but upon heredity. Could anything be
more un-American, to use the current word, or hostile to the spirit of
a free democracy?</p>

<p>In the intellectual domain politics works a greater havoc than in
the social. Politicians can no more tolerate independence in thought
and action than Charles V or Louis XIV or Napoleon I. "I have
never had confidence in political movements which pretend to be free
from politics," said the Governor of New York at the close of the
campaign that restored Tammany Hall to power in the metropolis,
showing that the intolerance of this form of warfare does not differ
from that of any other. "A creed that is worth maintaining at all,"
he added, using an argument made familiar by the agents of bigotry
everywhere, "is worth maintaining all the time.... Do not put
your faith in those that hide behind the pretense of nonpartisanship,"
he continued, striking a deadly blow at all party traitors; "it is a
device to trap the thoughtless and unsuspecting." As was shown
during the Blaine-Cleveland campaign of 1884, politicians treat dissent
as proof of unmistakable moral and intellectual baseness. Only
the progress of civilization prevents them from pouncing upon such
men as George William Curtis, Carl Schurz, and Wayne McVeagh
with the ferocity of the familiars of the Inquisition. As it is, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
regarded with more abhorrence than the members of the opposition;
they are treated with a greater wealth of contempt and hatred, and
often pursued with the malignant vindictiveness of the cruelest savages.
"I submit," said Mr. Wanamaker in one of his speeches
against the Quay machine, "that the service of self-respecting men is
lost to the Republican party by vile misrepresentations of reputable
people, employment of bogus detectives, venomous falsifiers, a subsidized
press, and conspirators who dare any plot or defilement, able
to exert political control, and by protecting legislation and by domination
of legal appointees of district attorneys and others not in elective
but appointive offices." During the memorable campaign of 1896,
when political bitterness and intolerance reached perhaps the highest
point in the history of the United States, thousands of voters,
driven by the scourge of "party regularity," either concealed or disavowed
their convictions, and marched under banners that meant
repudiation of public and private obligations. Even one of Mr.
Cleveland's Cabinet officers, who had stood up bravely for the gold
standard, succumbed to party discipline and became an apostate.
The intolerant spirit of politics extends to dictation of instruction of
students. The prolonged assaults of the protectionists upon Professor
Perry and Professor Sumner are well known. The same spirit
inspired the attack upon President Andrews, of Brown University,
the dismissal of the anti-Populist professors in the Agricultural College
of Kansas, and the populistic clamor against certain professors in
the universities of Missouri and Texas. That politics produces the
same contempt for culture and capacity that war does, evidence is not
lacking. "There is," said Senator Grady, of Tammany Hall, apologizing
for the appointment of some illiterate to office in New York
city, "a class of persons, chiefly the educated, who thinks that if a
man begins a sentence with a small letter, or uses a small 'i' in referring
to himself, or misspells common words, that he is unfit for
public office. Nothing could be further from the truth," he continues,
using an argument that the barbarians that overran Europe
might have made; "it is an idea that only the aristocracy of culture
could hold.... We do not want the people ruled by men," he adds,
giving a demagogic twist to his reasoning, "who are above them, or
who fancy they are because they have wealth or learning or blood,
nor by men who are below them, but we want them ruled in a genuine
democracy by men who are the representatives in all their ways
of thinking, feeling, speaking, and acting, of the average man."
What is wanted, in other words, is not men anxious to acquit themselves
with ability and fidelity to the public interests, but men that
will look after the interests of their organization and do the other
work of political <i>condottieri</i>. It can, of course, be a matter of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
consequence whether such men spell or speak correctly, or whether
they conduct themselves like boors and ruffians.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>As implied in all that has been said, it is, however, upon morals
that the effect of politics is the most deplorable. From the beginning
of the discussion of the party platform and the nomination of the candidates
to the induction of the successful combatants into office, the
principles applied to the transaction of business play the smallest possible
part. The principles observed are those of war. All the tactics
needful to achieve success in the one are indispensable to success in
the other. First, there is, as I have already said, an attempt to misrepresent
and injure political opponents, and, next, to confuse, befool,
and pillage the public. I shall not, however, describe the factional
conflicts that precede a convention&mdash;the intrigue, the bribery, the
circulation of false stories, and even the forgery of telegrams like the
one that brought about the nomination and defeat of Secretary
Folger. They exhibit only on a small scale the ethics of party warfare
in general. More needful is it to illustrate these, and to make
clear the vanity of any hope of moral reform through politics, or
through any other agency, either religious, philanthropic, or pedagogic,
as long as it remains a dominant activity of social life.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Gage had been a politician as well as a banker," said
Senator Frye, criticising the secretary's honesty and courage at a
time when both were urgently needed, "he would not have insisted
upon a declaration in favor of a single gold standard. It was all
right for him to submit his scheme of finance, but hardly politic to be
so specific about the gold standard." Always adjusted to this low
and debased conception of duty, a party platform is seldom or never
framed in accordance with the highest convictions of the most intelligent
and upright men in the party. The object is not the proclamation
of the exact truth, as they see it, but to capture the greatest
number of votes. If there is a vital question about which a difference
of opinion exists, the work of putting it into a form palatable to
everybody is intrusted to some cunning expert in verbal juggling.
A money plank, for instance, is drawn up in such a way that the
candidate standing upon it may be represented by editors and orators
of easy consciences as either for or against the gold standard. The
same was true for years of the slave and tariff questions; it is still
true of the temperance question, the question of civil-service reform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
and of every other question that threatens the slightest party division.
Again, questions are kept to the front that have no more vitality
than the dust of C&aelig;sar. Long after the civil war the issues of that
contest formed the stock in trade of the politicians and enabled them
to win many a battle that should have been fought on other grounds.
If need be, the grossest falsehoods are embodied in the platform, and
proclaimed as the most sacred tenets of party faith.</p>

<p>When the campaign opens, the ethics of the platform assume a
more violent and reprehensible shape. Not only are its hypocrisies
and falsehoods repeated with endless iteration, but they are multiplied
like the sands of the beach. Very few, if any, editors or orators
pretend to discuss questions or candidates with perfect candor and
honesty. Indeed, very few of them are competent to discuss them.
Hence sophistry and vilification take the place of knowledge and
reason. Were one party to adopt the Decalogue for a platform, the
other would find nothing in it to praise; it would be an embodiment
of socialism, or anarchism, or some other form of diabolism. If one
party were to nominate a saint, the other would paint him in colors
that Satan himself would hardly recognize. Not even such men as
Washington and Lincoln are immune to the assaults of political
hatred and mendacity. As the campaign draws to a close, we have a
rapidly increasing manifestation of all the worst traits of human
nature. In times of quiet, a confessed knave would scarcely be guilty
of them. False or garbled quotations from foreign newspapers are
issued. The old Cobden Club, just ready to give up the ghost, is galvanized
into the most vigorous life, and made to do valiant service
as a rich and powerful organization devoted to the subversion of
American institutions. Stories like Clay's sale of the presidency are
invented, and letters, like the Morey letter, are forged, and, despite
the most specific denials of their truth, they are given the widest currency.
Other forms of trickery, like the Murchison letter, written
by the British minister during Mr. Cleveland's second campaign, are
devised with devilish ingenuity, and made to contribute to the pressing
and patriotic work of rescuing the country from its enemies.</p>

<p>But this observation of the ethics of war does not stop with the
close of the polls, where bribery, intimidation, and fraud are practiced,
and the honest or dishonest count of the ballots that have been
cast; it is continued with the same infernal industry in the work of
legislation and administration. Upon the meeting of the statesmen
that the people have chosen under "the most perfect system of government
ever devised by man," what is the first thing that arrests
their attention and absorbs their energies? More intriguing, bargaining,
and bribery in a hundred forms, more or less subtle, to secure
election and appointment to positions within the gift of the legislature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
Little or no heed is given to the primary question of capacity
and public interests. Political considerations&mdash;that is, ability to help
or to harm some one&mdash;control all elections and appointments.
What is the next thing done? It is the preparation, introduction,
discussion, and passage of the measures thought to be essential to
the preservation of civilization. Here again political considerations
control action. Such measures are introduced as will strengthen
members with their constituents, or promote "the general welfare"
of the party. Very rarely have they "the general welfare" of the
public in view. Sometimes they seek to change district boundaries in
such a way as to keep the opposition in a perpetual minority. Sometimes
they have no other motive than the extortion of blackmail from
individuals or corporations. Sometimes their object is to throw "sop
to Cerberus"&mdash;that is, to pacify troublesome reformers within the
party, like the prohibitionists and the civil-service reformers. Sometimes
they authorize investigations into a department or a municipality
with the hope that discoveries will be made that will assist
the party in power or injure the party out of power; it happens not
infrequently that they are undertaken to smother some scandal, like
the mismanagement of the Pennsylvania treasury, or to whitewash
some rascal. Sometimes they create commissions, superintendents,
or inspectors, or other offices to provide rewards for party hacks and
heelers. Finally, there are the appropriation bills. Only a person
ignorant of the ways of legislators could be so simple-minded as to
imagine that they are miracles of economy, or that they are anything
else but the products of that clumsy but effective system of pillaging
known as log-rolling, which enables each to get what he wants
with the smallest regard for the interests of the taxpayer.</p>

<p>It is, however, during the debates over these wise and patriotic
measures that the public is favored with the most edifying exhibition
of the universal contempt of the legislator for its interests. They disclose
all the scandalous practices of a political campaign. There are
misrepresentations, recriminations, and not infrequently, as in the
case of Sumner, personal assaults. A perverse inclination always
exists toward those discussions that will put some one "in a hole," or
enable some one to arouse party passion. For this purpose nothing
is so effective as a foreign question, like a Cuban belligerency resolution,
or a treaty for the annexation of Hawaii, or a domestic question,
like responsibility for the crime of 1873, or the panic of 1893,
or a comparison of party devotion to the interests of the "old soldier."
Not the slightest heed, as has been shown on several occasions during
the past few years, is paid to the shock that may be given to business
or to the disturbance of pacific relations with foreign powers. In
fact, the greater the danger involved in the discussion of a delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
question, the more prone are the demagogues to mouth it. To such
questions as bankruptcy, railroad pooling, and currency reform will
they give their time and wisdom only when business interests have
almost risen in insurrection and compelled attention to them.</p>

<p>The same policy of hypocrisy, deception, favoritism, and proscription
is a dominant trait of the administration of the Government.
The object almost invariably in mind is the welfare or injury of some
party, or faction, or politician. The interests of the public are the last
thing thought of, if thought of at all. Take dismissals and appointments.
They may, as has been known to occur even in the United
States, be made to better the public service. Even then a careful
study of motive will disclose the characteristic purpose of the politician.
In a choice between two men of equal ability, or rather of equal
inability, which is more commonly the case, preference is given to the
one with the stronger "pull." Often, as has been shown within the
past year or two, convicted rascals are appointed at the behest of Congressmen
and in defiance of the wishes of the business community,
and, in spite of the civil-service laws, officials are dismissed because of
their politics alone. In the letting of contracts it is not difficult to
detect the observance of the same judicious rule. The virtuous formality
of letting to the lowest bidder may be gone through with, and
the public may be greatly pleased with this exhibition of official
deference to its interests. Yet an examination of the work done
under the supervision of complaisant inspectors, who may be blinded
in various ways to the defects of that of a political friend, or made
supernaturally alert to the defects of that of a political enemy, will
reveal a trail that does not belong to scrupulous integrity. That is
why dry docks, like that in Brooklyn, why harbor works, like those
in Charleston, turn out defective; why the Government has to pay
more for the transportation of the mails than a private corporation;
why the cost of the improvement of the Erie Canal was concealed
until nearly all the money voted for the folly had been expended;
why of the money expended one million dollars was wasted, if not
stolen; why so much of the State Capitol at Albany has been built
over again; why the City Hall in Philadelphia has been an interminable
job; why the supplies of prisons, asylums, and other public
institutions are constantly proving to be inferior to those paid for&mdash;why,
in a word, everything done by political methods is vitiated by
the ethics of war. In the enforcement of laws very little justice or
honesty can be found. As a rule, they bear much more harshly on
the poor and weak, that is, those with small political influence, than
on the rich and strong, that is, those with much political influence.
Take the enforcement of liquor laws, health laws, factory laws,
and compulsory school laws. If a man with political influence wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
to keep his children at home for any purpose, no truant officer is indiscreet
enough to trouble him; if, however, a poor woman, just
made a widow, wishes to have her oldest son work in disregard of the
statute, in order to keep her and her younger children out of the poor-house,
his official zeal is above criticism. Politics poisons even the
fountains of justice. Criminals that have sufficient political influence
can escape prosecution or obtain pardon after conviction. Prosecuting
officers are importuned incessantly, even by "leading citizens,"
to abandon prosecution of them or to "let them off easily." In the
appointment of receivers and referees, judges are much more inclined
to give preference to political friends than to political enemies.
Finally, if political exigencies require it, there is no hesitation to
invoke the latent savagery of a nation. In proof, recall the Venezuelan
message of Mr. Cleveland, which "dished" the Republican
jingoes, and the German emperor's assault upon Hayti and China to
secure the adoption of his naval bill. To make the record complete,
I ought to add that for a purpose more odious&mdash;namely, the increase
of sales&mdash;newspapers, always the ready recipients of political
patronage, commit the same atrocious crime against civilization.</p>

<p>Since politics is a form of civil war, involving aggressions upon
person and property, any extension of its field of operation must be
attended by precisely the same moral and economic effects that
attend the pursuit of civil war itself. No concession of suffrage to
women, nor any legal machinery, however ingenious, that may be
invented, will alter that fact. Already we are confronted with
alarming manifestations of the decadence of society that have always
accompanied civil strife. The public burdens are becoming so great,
equaling the per capita rate prevailing at the outbreak of the French
Revolution, that people in cities as well as in the country are being
driven from their homes by the sale of their property for unpaid
taxes. Both classes are joining the ranks of "the disinherited," just
as similar classes joined the brigands in France and Italy, and are
clamoring for the trial of the thousand absurd schemes for social
ills known as populism and socialism, all meaning an increase of the
functions of government, still further aggressions upon persons and
property, and an aggravation of the evils already complained of. At
the same time the moral tone of society is rapidly sinking to a
low level. "It is a melancholy reflection," says the report of the
New York State tax commission, dwelling upon the desperate efforts
of people to escape the aggressions committed on them and disclosing
the observance of a code of ethics committed in every walk in life,
"that in this Christian age neither the memory of early moral training,
nor present religious profession, hopes or fears for the hereafter, the
penalties of the law, nor any other possible considerations are sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
to restrain the average possessor of personal property from
forcing other men to pay the taxes for which he is justly liable, by
methods unquestionably immoral, if not absolutely criminal." Further
evidence of the same startling and deplorable fact, one recalling
the cruel indifference of the privileged classes of the ancient <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
to the sufferings of the people that bore the burdens that they ought
to have shared, is to be found in the universal tendency of people
to get public improvements at the expense of others, such as free
baths, normal schools, interoceanic canals, etc., and the shocking
prevalence of crimes of violence in every part of the country. To be
sure, there are coupled with this alarming decadence extraordinary
religious, philanthropic, and pedagogic efforts to rescue society from
the depths of degradation to which it is sinking. But, as is shown
by the history of the unparalleled moral enthusiasm of thousands of
ascetics and teachers of the highest character during the decadence of
Rome and the disorders of the middle ages, they will be absolutely
ineffective as long as the conditions prevail that engender envy,
hatred, deception, plunder, and murder, destroying not only morality,
but every vestige of fellow-feeling and patriotism. "There is a nation,"
says Mr. Bodley in his new book on France, bringing out this
profound and important truth, "to the members of which Frenchmen
are more revengeful than to the Germans, more irascible than
to the Italians, more unjust than to the English. It is to the French
that Frenchmen display animosity more savage, more incessant, and
more inequitable than to any other race." Precisely the same effect
is to be noticed in the United States&mdash;the inevitable effect of every
form of aggression, even though it have the most benevolent object
in view.</p>

<p>Yet the conclusion is not that people should abstain from politics.
That would involve greater evils than those that now prevail. It
would be submission to aggression&mdash;freedom to predatory politicians
to continue their pillage. The thing to be done is to take up arms
against them, and to wage relentless war on them. But the object
of the struggle must not be the substitution of one set of politicians
for another, but to reduce to the smallest possible limits the sphere of
all political activity. Until this is done there can be no release from
so important a duty to self and to the community.</p>

<h2>MY PET SCORPION.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By NORMAN ROBINSON.</span></p>


<p>When I first came to Florida I heard terrible accounts of the
deadly work of a poisonous "bug," popularly known as the
"grampus" or "mule-killer."</p>

<p>My first informant was a "Florida cracker," who seemed fairly
intelligent, and whom I had employed in a little woodcraft. He
happened to encounter one of those terrible creatures, and promptly
"smashed" it with his axe. On expressing regret that I had no opportunity
of seeing it before it was crushed into so shapeless a mass,
he gravely assured me that he "didn't take no resks on them varmints.
Them's the pisenest things in Floridy. Rattlers ain't nowhar!
A man what gits bit by one of them critters&mdash;no medicine
can't save him! We calls 'em mule-killers, cause they's wust on
mules. A hoss nor a dog don't seem to mind 'em, but a mule is
done dead when one of them varmints strikes 'em."</p>

<p>I cross-questioned my informant a little as to his personal
knowledge of the matter, and especially as to the fatal results
following the bite of this very astonishing "bug." "Did you
ever know," said I, "of a mule's dying from the bite of this 'mule-killer'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've knowed of several, and I hearn tell of lots. Ole
man Jernigan, he loss a likely mule what got struck by one of them
critters, and there was a man what died down to the Johnson place,
bit by one of them things. They tells me he took whisky enough
to kill two men, but it didn't do him no bit of good. He was powerful
fond of whisky, anyway, and he died mighty easy."</p>

<p>I subsequently made some inquiries in regard to these supposed
casualties, and came to the conclusion that my informant's accounts
of them were largely mythical. A mule had died in the neighborhood
mentioned, but the "mule-killer" was colic; and in the case of
the man, although he claimed to have been bitten by a "grampus,"
it was generally believed that the "serpent of the still" was the most
deadly "varmint" he had recently encountered.</p>

<p>I soon found, however, that the belief in the venomous character
of this "whip scorpion," or <i>Thelyphonus giganteus</i>, as it proved to
be, was almost universal. The negroes, especially, are in mortal
terror of it. Only a few days since a colored boy that I had employed
in hauling wood brought me a small specimen, completely
crushed, with the triumphant announcement, "I've got him, but he
like to done strike me 'fore I seed him."</p>

<p>"But how do they bite?" I asked, "with their claws?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dey don't bite at all! Dey jes' strike you with de tail, and
dey's a pizen juice comes out, and den no doctor kain't save you!"</p>

<p>Newspaper stories confirming this belief occasionally go the
rounds. I remember reading one particularly circumstantial account
of the mishaps of a camping party somewhere in south Florida.
"They were a long way," said this veracious chronicler, "from any
human habitation, and the loss of their one mule from the bite of
this pestiferous scorpion brought with it no end of inconvenience and
trouble."</p>

<p>The distressing story was told with great detail, and it was certainly
not calculated to diminish the popular dread with which this
supposed venomous creature is regarded. Even in scientific journals
we find an occasional echo of this general belief. Dr. Packard, too,
certainly good authority, in his Study of Insects accepts the current
theory.</p>

<p>In the Proceedings of the Washington (D. C.) Entomological
Society there is an interesting discussion of this very question (vol. ii,
No. 2). Professor Howard stated that a case of the bite of the
<i>Thelyphonus</i> with fatal results was vouched for by a Mr. Dunn, a
professed naturalist, and that his testimony was entitled to weight.
Mr. Ashmead and Mr. Banks, both of whom had been familiar with
the <i>Thelyphonus</i> in Florida, had handled them frequently, and believed
them harmless. Dr. George Marx confirmed this view by
stating that dissection failed to show the presence of any poison sac
or fangs, a statement which it seems has been confirmed by subsequent
investigations.</p>

<p>Altogether here was a "muddle" of conflicting testimony, which
could only be accounted for by supposing "some one had blundered."</p>

<p>A few months since, for my own satisfaction, I determined to
make a special study of our Florida "grampus." Not the least
curious question that first suggests itself is how this name, "grampus"
(French, <i>Grand poisson</i>, <i>great fish</i>), one of the <i>Cetace&aelig;</i>, ever
got tacked on as a popular label for our Florida <i>Thelyphonus</i>. I am
utterly at a loss to account for it.</p>

<p>Before catching "my bird" I, of course, had to make a cage for
it. This was constructed out of a large cigar box. About half of
one end was removed and replaced by wire gauze. In addition to
the hinged wooden cover, with which the box was furnished, I arranged
a second one of wire gauze, hinged on the opposite side, and
closing underneath the wooden one. This gave full control of light
and air, both by day and night, without disturbing my future prisoner,
and at the same time diminished the danger of his escape.</p>

<p>I knew very well that the scorpion I was after was of a very
modest and retiring disposition, and was never seen above ground in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
daylight except by accident or mistake. I was also under the impression
that they were becoming rather rare, as it was more than
a year since I had seen one. Still, it was with the most abundant
confidence, to say nothing of the more prosaic requisites of a stout
pair of gloves, a paper bag, and a hoe, that I started out one afternoon
to find my <i>Thelyphonus</i>. I directed my course to the nearest
wood, not for a moment doubting that a few hours' work would
bring to light the object of my search. I labored faithfully until
dark, overturning rotten logs, sticks, bark, old rails, and other field
and woodland <i>d&eacute;bris</i> under which my "grampus" would be likely
to be hiding, but the search was altogether fruitless.</p>

<p>I then concluded to try a plan which I have usually found quite
successful. I told some of the bright boys in town what I wanted,
and offered them a liberal price for every live "grampus" they
would bring, cautioning them that their bite was said to be poisonous,
and at the same time instructing them exactly how to catch and
handle them. This scheme was also a failure. I then asked several
friends who are interested in natural history to aid me in the search.
One gentleman, who is a surveyor, and who in the pursuit of his profession
passes much of his time in the woods, entered with special
interest into my quest. These plans were all equally barren of
results.</p>

<p>One day, after I had practically given up the search, I was hoeing
among the sprouts at the base of an old orange tree that had
fallen a victim to the "big freeze" when, under a pile of chips at
the base of the old stump, I suddenly unearthed my long-looked-for
<i>Thelyphonus</i>. It was a fine, full-grown specimen, decidedly resentful
at this sudden intrusion upon its privacy, and if a formidable pair
of expanded claws, brandishing tail, and a generally vicious look
meant anything, it was a customer that a prudent man would not
care to pick up with bare hands. With the aid of a wide-mouthed
preserving jar and a stick it was, however, soon secured, and in a
short time transferred to the cage that had been so long waiting for
its occupant.</p>

<p>A few words may not be amiss concerning the great family of
which my little captive is not the least interesting member. The
<i>Thelyphonid&aelig;</i> belong to the great spider family, <i>Arachnida</i>, which
includes not only the true spiders, but also the mites (<i>Acarids</i>), the
ticks (<i>Ixodes</i>), the <i>Tartarides</i>, <i>Phrynides</i>, <i>Phalangides</i>, and other
more or less related and mostly tropical groups. The whole subclass
has certain pretty well-defined characteristics. They are almost
without exception carnivorous (<i>insectivorous</i>). They are seldom
subject to metamorphosis. The legs are usually eight in number.
The eyes are always situated on the cephalo-thorax (head and breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
plate), and not infrequently are the same in number as the legs.
Not a few are fitted with poison sacs and fangs, and in the case of
some of the larger true spiders and scorpions the venom is very
virulent, and in some instances has proved fatal to human life.</p>

<p>As this is hardly the place for a technical description of my
<i>Thelyphonus</i>&mdash;a female&mdash;I shall content myself with a few facts
and measurements. Those who are curious as to her personal appearance
can consult the accompanying photograph. Most persons will
conclude that her beauty is not even "skin deep."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illo_037.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="Photograph of a Thelyphonus" />
</div>

<p>The following post-mortem data will perhaps aid in giving a
clearer idea of this curious little creature. The length of the body
from the front of the cephalo-thorax to the end of the last post-abdominal
segment was fifty-two
millimetres&mdash;a little
more than two inches; the
length of the tail was fifty
millimetres, thus making
the total length about four
inches. The width of the
abdomen in its widest part,
near the center, was thirteen
millimetres, or approximately
half an inch. The claw-bearing
palpi, or "feelers,"
which are large and very
powerful, have an extreme
expansion of fifty-eight millimetres, nearly two and a half inches.
The tail is a curious organ, and consists of forty-four short, jointed
sections of a pale wine color, with a light yellow ring at the
base; a few short, scattered pointed hairs are found on each segment.
It is about two thirds of a millimetre in thickness at
the base and tapers to about half this diameter at the end. When
alarmed, the <i>Thelyphonus</i> holds it curved over forward after the
manner of the true scorpions; a habit that probably points to some
common ancestor. Its true function appears to be that of an extra
palpus or "feeler."</p>

<p>The <i>Thelyphonus</i> is generally of a wine color. In some places,
as on the cephalo-thorax, this color is black; around the mouth parts,
the legs, the sternal plate, and the under side of the abdomen, this
wine color is very pronounced.</p>

<p>The eyes are eight in number. Two of them are close together,
on opposite sides of a slightly elevated ridge at the front of the
cephalo-thorax. These eyes are bright, black, and beadlike, and
about two thirds of a millimetre in diameter. A little farther back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
on the outer edges of the cephalo-thorax, are placed the remaining
six eyes, three on a side, in a triangular group. These eyes are not
quite as large as those in front, but they are of a shining yellow color,
and altogether give the face of the whip scorpion a decidedly uncanny
look.</p>

<p>But to return to the history of my pet. As Madam Thelyphonus
had obviously been accustomed to rather primitive furniture, I did
not overburden her new apartments. A thickly sanded floor, a salt
dish filled with fresh water, a square of pine bark the size of my
hand, slightly elevated, with a few nice pieces of green moss to remind
her of the country home she had left, and my involuntary guest
was ready for housekeeping. She accepted her new quarters without
question or examination, and promptly retired to her bedroom under
the bark.</p>

<p>But housekeeping, even for a whip scorpion, involves the food
question. Here I was upon uncertain ground. The strictly nocturnal
habits of the <i>Thelyphonus</i> render all such investigations difficult.
Naturally, the authorities on this point are somewhat indefinite
or conflicting. The first things which I placed in the cage were
a number of roaches of assorted sizes. One investigator claims that
they are readily eaten by the <i>Thelyphonus</i>. Twenty-four hours
passed and not a roach was missing.</p>

<p>The matter, however, in which I felt a more immediate interest
was the supposed venomous character of my new pet. My experiments
were, therefore, especially directed to the settlement of this
question. The next night a large, full-grown toad, that for some time
had made his home in my back yard, was placed in the cage. The
roaches were still there, and right here a very interesting thing happened.
The largest cockroach, nearly two inches in length, was upon
the side of the cage. The toad had hardly got comfortably seated
immediately in front of him when the cockroach suddenly disappeared.
I could not say that I saw him disappear. I was looking
directly at both, but the "dissolving view" was too rapid for the
eye to follow. To say that it was "quick as a flash" would depend
somewhat on what kind of a "flash" was meant. I think nitroglycerin
would undoubtedly have kept up with my <i>bufo</i>; but, judging
from what I saw, or rather didn't see, I should say that this toad
could have swallowed about six cockroaches while gunpowder was
getting ready to go off! Any one who wishes to get an entirely new
view of the meaning of the phrase "with neatness and dispatch"
should by all means try this "lightning combination" of cockroaches
and a Florida toad!</p>

<p>And now I was all ready for the coming "battle royal" that I
had reason to suppose would take place between my little captives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
I cautiously removed the bark under which Madam Thelyphonus
was hiding, and then awaited results.</p>

<p>They didn't come. The <i>Thelyphonus</i> kept perfectly still, ditto
the toad. I must stir them up. With a stick I tried to irritate the
scorpion. She proved a perfect marvel of patience. She wouldn't
"irritate" worth a cent. I poked the toad over and on top of the
supposed vicious and venomous creature. The latter crept out from
under her unusual burden and crawled into a corner. The toad in a
dazed sort of way pulled himself together and hopped off. I still
kept up my pokings and proddings, thinking that possibly my
"grampus" could at last be teased into some manifestation of her
supposed deadly powers. It was a complete failure. Madam Thelyphonus
proved to be a perfect model of patient endurance under
persecution. All I could do, there was not a sign or motion of resentment.
She could not be teased or tormented into biting, pinching,
or fighting anything or anybody. My little captive had all the
"ornaments of a meek and quiet spirit," and her only desire seemed
to be to get out of the way. Now here was certainly a curious contrast
between reputation and real character. A whole Stateful of
slanderous natural history was disappearing under my very eyes!
"Mule-killer," indeed! Why, my little captive couldn't be coaxed
or goaded into harming a fly. In patient sufferance and persistent
good nature she could have given points to "Uncle Toby," in his
celebrated interview with that annoying insect. Still, although this
first experiment quite convinced me that my <i>Thelyphonus</i> was entirely
harmless, I concluded to leave my captives together for the
night. In the morning, as I expected, both were in the best of
health and spirits, the toad eager to jump out, the scorpion eager
to be let alone.</p>

<p>The next night I tried a mouse. This sharp-toothed, frisky little
rodent would, I thought, be likely to get into trouble if there was
any to be found. The teasing process was not repeated, as it had
proved such a complete failure. The mouse, however, ran round the
cage, tumbling over the <i>Thelyphonus</i>, in the most rapid and reckless
way. Every time the latter seemed to regard these awkward encounters
as unavoidable accidents, and excused them accordingly.
As to biting, pinching, or resenting them in any way, she showed
not the slightest symptom of them. She simply crawled into a
corner and kept as quiet as circumstances would permit. As in the
case of the toad, both were left together overnight. All that really
happened, so far as I could see, was that the mouse had nearly
gnawed a hole through the cage; but evidently he was none the
worse for having shared his bedroom with this terrible "mule-killer,"
"worse than a rattlesnake," according to the accepted belief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span></p>

<p>It is certainly a curious question how so perfectly harmless a
creature can have acquired such a bad reputation. I know of no
modern parallel. In Shakespeare's time a similar popular prejudice
was entertained against one of the most useful servants that farmers
and horticulturists possess. The well-known lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The toad, ugly and venomous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds yet a precious jewel in its head"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>were but the echo of this crude and cruel fancy. So with our
<i>Thelyphonus</i>. It is not only absolutely harmless, but, as I shall soon
show, one of the most useful helps in keeping within bounds one of
our most serious pests.</p>

<p>The comment that I once heard, by a not over-intelligent and
somewhat profane individual, upon seeing a dead whip scorpion&mdash;"Any
---- fool can see that that critter is rank pisin!"&mdash;probably
partially explains the matter. It must be conceded that the looks of
the <i>Thelyphonus</i> are decidedly against it. Its long, frisky tail, its
big, threatening claws, and its generally uncanny and vicious appearance
are quite sufficient to inspire caution if not positive dread. It
"looks pisin," and that settles it with the ignorant. With the better
informed the fact that the creature belongs to a bad family, that
its nearest relatives are unquestionably venomous, may help to explain,
though it can hardly excuse, the widespread currency which
even scientific men have helped to give to a most erroneous and
slanderous belief.</p>

<p>And now as to the food question. This, of course, was a very
vital matter to my little prisoner, and one of great interest to me.
After the failure of the cockroach diet, I next tried grasshoppers.
These also have been declared to be greatly relished by the <i>Thelyphonus</i>.
I did not find it so. The first one placed in the cage was,
to be sure, partially eaten. But, unfortunately, a colony of ants had
got into the cage, and were dining on my dead <i>Gryllus</i>. This left the
matter a little uncertain. On fencing out these intruders, and repeating
the experiment with the same and half a dozen other species, I
became convinced that my <i>Thelyphonus</i>, at least, was not fond of
grasshoppers. Then began a kind of general system, or no system,
of haphazard feeding, or rather trials of food. My marketing range
for my particular "boarder" was by no means a limited one. During
the month of September, when most of these investigations were in
progress, Florida is by no means deficient in insect life. Every day
from two to ten new and different species were placed in the cage.
A list was kept, to avoid repetition, until my captive was offered her
choice of something over a hundred varieties of "bugs," worms,
grubs, spiders, ants and their eggs, lizards, butterflies, etc.&mdash;everything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
indeed, that I could think of or conveniently catch, which it
seemed possible my little captive might fancy. Of all this heterogeneous
collection, nothing, so far as I could see, was ever killed or eaten.
A tiny piece of fresh beef, placed in her cage at night, was the only
thing that I could persuade her to touch. Even of this I am not
absolutely certain. In the morning these little pellets of fresh meat
were usually found rolled in the sand and often apparently diminished
in size. Several times they disappeared altogether. The presence,
however, of other predatory insects sometimes left the matter a
little in doubt. But, as my captive remained in good health for over
a month while this plan of trial dieting was in progress, I am inclined
to think that more or less of the fresh beef was really consumed by
her. Still, she took the greatest care that I should never catch her
eating, even when surprised with a sudden light at night, a time
when she was always especially active.</p>

<p>I was getting a little tired of this seemingly fruitless investigation,
and had about concluded to persuade my <i>Thelyphonus</i> to crawl
into a bottle in company with a few drops of chloroform, to have her
picture taken, and then forward the "embalmed remains" to the
Museum of Natural History in Central Park, New York, to which
they had already been promised.</p>

<p>I concluded, however, to make one more effort. So the next day
I spent some time in hunting for new and untried insects, of which
I procured half a dozen or so, and among other things quite a lot of
so-called "wood-lice," "white ants," <i>termites</i>, our only representative
of a family that in most warm countries is so destructive to exposed
wooden structures. All of these "finds" were tumbled, as
usual, upon the floor of my captive's cage, and I left them with very
little expectation that she would see among them anything that
suited her fastidious taste. The next morning, to my surprise, every
white ant had disappeared; nothing else was touched. The question
was solved. For about three weeks my <i>Thelyphonus</i> was supplied
each day with a liberal allowance of what in this latitude, at least,
seems to be its exclusive food.</p>

<p>Now, this white ant (<i>Termes flavipes</i>) is in Florida one of our
worst pests. Possibly there may be some compensating benefits
which they confer, in the more rapid removal of decaying vegetable
matter. In most respects, however, they are an unmitigated nuisance.
The annual destruction of property, of fencing, building
foundations, and exposed woodwork of every kind must be estimated
at hundreds of thousands of dollars. The worst of it is, too, that
it is impossible to know when they are at work. They are always
hidden. In case they are compelled in their destructive labors to
pass over the outside of anything, they always build a hard gallery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
of cemented sand or clay, under which they travel securely. Unfortunately,
too, they do not always confine their ravages to dead
wood. Every orange grower fears them, and if they once get a foothold
the tree that they attack is often destroyed before anything is
suspected to be the matter. They "love darkness rather than light,"
and "their deeds are evil." And it is these miserable pests that my
little-appreciated and much-slandered <i>Thelyphonus</i> has been all her
life fighting! And those big, strong claws of hers, that look so formidable,
what are they for but to tear down and break in pieces the
hard, honeycombed structures in which her food is hidden? It was
all plain enough now!</p>

<p>I confess, when I first discovered these facts which turn popular
natural history so completely topsy-turvy, I felt like taking off my
hat and making my profoundest bow to my little captive, and in
the name of justice and humanity asking pardon for all the slanders
and indignities heaped upon her race.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, a private note from Prof. L. O. Howard,
chief of the Division of Entomology in the United States Department
of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., furnishes important additional
testimony upon the question of the harmlessness of this
arachnid. Professor Howard says, "The <i>Thelyphonus</i> is not poisonous."</p>

<p>Perhaps a way of reconciling at least some of the conflicting
statements that have been made on the subject may be found in the
facts revealed by modern bacteriological investigations. It is well
known that under special conditions the bite of the most harmless
animal may convey to the human system pathogenic germs which
will speedily prove fatal. Most of the deaths reported in the newspapers
from the bite of the <i>Thelyphonus</i> are no doubt imaginary,
or due entirely to other causes. Any well-authenticated case&mdash;if
such there has been&mdash;is probably to be explained in the manner
above indicated. This theory, too, helps to "let down easy" some
prominent naturalists whose great names have served to give
countenance to one of the most widespread and persistent errors
in current natural history.</p>

<h2>THE PEOPLES OF THE BALKAN PENINSULA&mdash;THE GREEK, THE SLAV, AND THE TURK.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By WILLIAM Z. RIPLEY, Ph. D.</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap lowercase">ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY; LECTURER
IN ANTHROPO-GEOGRAPHY AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.</span></p>


<p>The significant geography of the Balkan Peninsula may best be
illustrated by comparing it with the other two south European
ones, Italy and Spain. The first point to notice is that it is divided
from the mainland by rivers and not by a well-defined mountain
chain. Iberia begins definitely at the Pyrenees, and Italy proper is
cut off from Europe by the Apennine chain. On the other hand, it is
along the line of the Danube and of its western affluent, the Save (see
map between pages 614 and 615), that we find the geographical limits
of the Balkan Peninsula. This boundary, as will be observed, excludes
the kingdom of Roumania, seeming to distinguish it from its
trans-Danubian neighbor Bulgaria. This is highly proper, viewed
from the standpoint of geography and topography. For Roumania
is, for the most part, an extensive and rich alluvial plain; while the
Balkan Peninsula, as soon as you leave the Bulgarian lowlands, is
characteristically rugged, if not really mountainous.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illo_044_peoples.jpg" width="500" height="419" alt="Peoples of the Balkan Peninsula--After Sax '78" />
<span class="caption">[<a href="images/illo_044_peoples_large.jpg">Larger image</a>]</span>
</div>

<p>From Adrianople west to the Adriatic, and from the Balkan
Mountains and the Save River south to the plains of Epirus and
Thessaly, extends an elevated region upward of two thousand feet
above the sea, breaking up irregularly into peaks often rising above
five thousand feet. There is no system in these mountains. The
land is rudely broken up into a multitude of little "gateless amphitheaters,"
too isolated for union, yet not inaccessible enough for individuality.
As White observes, "If the peninsula, instead of being
the highly mountainous and diversified district it is, had been a
plateau, a very different distribution of races would have obtained at
the present day." Nor can one doubt for a moment that this disordered
topography has been an important element in the racial history
of the region.</p>

<p>In its other geographical characteristics this peninsula is seemingly
more favored than either Spain or Italy. More varied than
the former, especially in its union of the two flora of north and south;
far richer in contour, in the possession of protected waters and good
harbors than Italy; the Balkan Peninsula, nevertheless, has been,
humanly speaking, unfortunate from the start. The reason is patent.
It lies in its central or rather intermediate location. It is betwixt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
and between; neither one thing nor the other. Surely a part of
Europe, its rivers all run to the east and south. "By physical relief
it turns its back on Europe," continually inviting settlement from
the direction of Asia. It is no anomaly that Asiatic religions, Asiatic
institutions, and Asiatic races should have possessed and held it; nor
that Europe, Christianity, and the Aryan-speaking races should have
resisted this invasion of territory which they regarded in a sense as
their own. In this pull and haul between the social forces of the two
continents we finally discover the dominant influence, perhaps, which
throughout history has condemned this region to political disorder
and ethnic heterogeneity.</p>

<p>As little racial as of topographical system can we discover in this
Balkan Peninsula. Only in one respect may we venture upon a little
generalization. This is suggested by the preliminary bird's-eye view
which we must take as to the languages spoken in the peninsula.
This was a favorite theme with the late historian Freeman. It is
developed in detail in his luminous writings upon the Eastern question.
The Slavs have in this part of Europe played a r&ocirc;le somewhat
analogous to, although less successful than, that of the Teutons in
the west. They have pressed in upon the territory of the classic civilizations
of Greece and Rome, ingrafting a new and physically vigorous
population upon the old and partially enervated one. From some
center of dispersion up north toward Russia, Slavic-speaking peoples
have expanded until they have rendered all eastern Europe Slavic
from the Arctic Ocean to the Adriatic and &AElig;gean Seas. Only at one
place is the continuity of Slavdom broken; but this interruption is
sufficient to set off the Slavs into two distinct groups at the present
day. The northern one, of which we have already treated,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> consists of
the Russians, Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks. The southern group, now
before us, comprises the main body of the Balkan peoples from the
Serbo-Croatians to the Bulgars, as shown upon the accompanying
map. Between these two groups of Slavs&mdash;and herein is the significant
point&mdash;is a broad belt of non-Slavic population, composed of
the Magyars, linguistically now as always Finns; and the Roumanians,
who have become Latin in speech within historic times. This
intrusive, non-Slavic belt lies along or near the Danube, that great
highway over which eastern peoples have penetrated Europe for centuries.
The presence of this water way is distinctly the cause of the
linguistic phenomenon. Rome went east; and the Finns, like the
Huns, went west along it, with the result as described. Linguistically
speaking, therefore, the boundary of the southern Slavs and that of
the Balkan Peninsula, beginning, as we have said, at the Danube, are
one and the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span></p>

<p>We may best begin our ethnic description by the apportionment
of the entire Balkan Peninsula into three linguistic divisions, viz., the
Greeks, the Slavs, and the Tatar-Turks. Of these the second is numerically
the most important, comprising the Serbo-Croatians, the
Albanians, and, in a measure, the Bulgarians. Their distribution is
manifested upon our map, to which we have already directed attention.
These Slavic-speaking peoples form not far from half the entire
population. Next in order come the Greeks, who constitute probably
about a third of the total. As our map shows, this Greek contingent
is closely confined to the seacoast, with the exception of Thessaly,
which, as an old Hellenic territory, we are not surprised to find Greek
in speech to-day. The Slavs, contrasted with the Greeks, are primarily
an inland population; the only place in all Europe, in fact,
where they touch the sea is along the Adriatic coast. Even here the
proportion of Greek intermixture is more considerable than our map
would seem to imply. The interest of this fact is intensified because
of the well-deserved reputation as admirable sailors which the modern
Dalmatians possess. They are the only natural navigators of all the
vast Slavic world. Everywhere else these peoples are noted rather for
their aptitude for agriculture and allied pursuits. There is still another
important point to be noted concerning the Greeks. They
form not only the fringe of coast population in Asiatic as well as in
European Turkey; they, with the Jews, monopolize the towns, devoting
themselves to commerce as well as navigation. Jews and
Greeks are the natural traders of the Orient. Thus is the linguistic
segregation between Greek and Slav perpetuated, if not intensified,
by seemingly natural aptitudes.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most surprising feature of our map of Turkey is the
relative insignificance of the third element, the Turks. There were
ten years ago, according to Couvreur, not above seven hundred and
fifty thousand of them in all European Turkey. Bradaska estimated
that they were outnumbered by the Slavs seven to one. Our map
shows that they form the dominant element in the population only in
eastern Bulgaria, where they indeed constitute a solid and coherent
body. Everywhere else they are disseminated as a small minority
among the Greeks or Slavs. Even about Constantinople itself the
Greeks far outnumber them. In this connection we must bear in
mind that we are now judging of these peoples in no sense by their
physical characteristics, but merely by the speech upon their lips.
Nowhere else in Europe, as we shall soon see, is this criterion so fallacious
as in the Balkan states. Religion enters also as a confusing
element. Sax's original map, from which ours is derived, distinguishes
these religious affiliations as well as language. He was indeed
the first to employ this additional test. The maze of tangled languages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
and religions upon his map proved too complicated for
our imitative abilities. We were obliged to limit our cartography
to languages alone. The reader who would gain a true conception
of the ethnic heterogeneity of Turkey should consult his
original map.</p>

<p>The word Turk was for several centuries taken in a religious sense
as synonymous with Mohammedan,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> as in the Collect for Good Friday
in its reference to "Jews, Turks, infidels, and heretics." Thus in
Bosnia, where in the fifteenth century many Slavs were converted to
Mohammedanism, their descendants are still known as Turks, especially
where they use the Turkish speech in their religion. Obviously
in this case no Turkish blood need flow in their veins. It is the religion
of Islam, acting in this way, which has served to keep the Turks
as distinct from the Slavs and Greeks as they are to-day. Freeman
has drawn an instructive comparison in this connection between the
fate of the Bulgars, who, as we shall see, are merely Slavonized Finns,
and the Turks, who have steadily resisted all attempts at assimilation.
The first came, he says, as "mere heathen savages (who) could be
Christianized, Europeanized, assimilated," because no antipathy save
that of race and speech had to be overcome. The Turks, in contradistinction,
came "burdened with the half-truth of Islam, with the half-civilization
of the East." By the aid of these, especially the former,
the Turk has been enabled to maintain an independent existence as
"an unnatural excrescence" on this corner of Europe.</p>

<p>Even using this word as in a measure synonymous with religious
affiliations, the Turks form but a small and decreasing minority in
the Balkan Peninsula. Couvreur affirms that not over one third of
the population profess the religion of Islam, all the remainder being
Greek Catholics. This being so, the query at once suggests itself as
to the reason for the continued political domination of this Turkish
minority, Asiatic alike in race, in speech, and in religion. The
answer is certain. It depends upon that subtle principle, the balance
of power in Europe. Is it not clear that to allow the Turk to go
under, as numerically he ought to do, would mean to add strength
to the great Slavic majority, affiliated as it is with Russia both by
speech and religion? This, with the consent of the Anglo-Saxon and
other Teutonic rivals of the Slav, could never be allowed. Thus does
it come about that the poor Greek is ground between the upper Turkish
and the nether Slavic millstone. "Unnatural disunion is the fate
of the whole land, and the cuckoo-cry about the independence and
integrity of the Ottoman Empire means, among the other evil things
that it means, the continuance of this disunion." Let us turn from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
distressing political spectacle to observe what light, if any, anthropology
may shed upon the problem.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the relative isolation of the Greeks at the extreme southern
point of the peninsula and especially in the Peloponnesus, it would
seem that they might be relatively free from those ethnic disturbances
which have worked such havoc elsewhere in the Orient. Nevertheless,
Grecian history recounts a continuous succession of inroads
from the landward north, as well as from the sea. It would transcend
the limits of our study to attempt any detailed analysis of the early
ethnology of the country.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Examination of the relationship of the
Pelasgi to their contemporaries we leave to the philologists. Positively
no anthropological data on the matter exist. We are sufficiently
grateful for the hundred or more well-authenticated ancient Greek
crania of any sort which remain to us. It is useless to attempt any
inquiry as to their more definite ethnic origin within the tribal
divisions of the country.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The testimony of these ancient Greek
crania is perfectly harmonious. All authorities agree that the ancient
Hellenes were decidedly long-headed, betraying in this respect their
affinity to the Mediterranean race, which we have already traced
throughout southern Europe and Africa.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Whether from Attica;
from Schliemann's successive cities excavated upon the site of Troy;
or from the coast of Asia Minor; at all times from 400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> to the third
century of our era; it would seem proved that the Greeks were of this
dolichocephalic type. Stephanos gives the average cranial index of
them all as about 75.7, betokening a people like the present Calabrians
in head form; and, for that matter, about as long-headed as the
Anglo-Saxons in England and America. More than this concerning
the physical traits of these ancient Greeks we can not establish with
any certainty. No perfect skeletons from which we can ascertain
their statures remain to us. Nor can we be more positive as to their
brunetness. Their admiration for blondness in heroes and deities is
well known. As Dr. Beddoe ('93) says, almost all of Homer's favorites
were blond or chestnut-haired, as well as large and tall. Lapouge<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
seems inclined to regard this as proof that the Greeks themselves were
of this type, a deduction which appears to us in no wise well founded.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
As we shall see, every characteristic in their modern descendants and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
every analogy with the neighboring populations leads us to the conclusion
that the classical Hellenes were distinctly of the Mediterranean
racial types, little different from the Ph&oelig;nicians, the Romans, or the
Iberians.</p>

<p>Since the Christian era, as we have said, a successive downpour of
foreigners from the north into Greece has ensued.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In the sixth
century came the Avars and the Slavs, bringing death and disaster.
A more potent and lasting influence upon the country was probably
produced by the slower and more peaceful infiltration of the Slavs
into Thessaly and Epirus from the end of the seventh century onward.
A result of this is that Slavic place names to-day occur all over the
Peloponnesus in the open country where settlements could readily
be made. The most important immigration of all is probably that of
the Albanians, who, from the thirteenth century until the advent of
the Turks, incessantly penetrated the land. As a result the Albanian
language is spoken to-day over a considerable part of the Peloponnesus,
especially in its northeastern corner, where it attaches to the
mainland. Only one little district has preserved, it may be added,
anything like the original classical Greek speech. The Tzakons, in a
little isolated and very rugged district on the eastern coast, include
a number of classical idioms in their language. Everywhere else,
either in the names of rivers, mountains, and towns, or in borrowed
words, evidence of the powerful influence of the Slavic infiltration
occurs. This has induced Fallmerayer, Philippson, and others to
assert that the Slavs have in fact submerged the original Greeks entirely.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Explicit rebuttal of this is offered by Hopf, Hertzberg, and
Tozer, who admit the Slavic element, but still declare the Greeks to be
Greek. This is a matter concerning which neither philologist nor
geographer has a right to speak; the anthropological testimony is the
only competent one. To this we turn.</p>

<p>The modern Greeks are a very mixed people. There can be no
doubt of this fact from a review of their history. In despite of this,
they still remain distinctly true to their original Mediterranean ancestry.
This has been most convincingly proved in respect of their
head form.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The cephalic index of modern living Greeks ranges with
great constancy about 81. This, it should be observed, betokens an
appreciably broader head than in the case of the ancient Hellenes.
Stephanos, who has measured several hundred recruits, finds dolichocephaly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
to be most prevalent in Thessaly and Attica; while broad-headedness,
so characteristic, as we shall see, of the Albanians and
other Slavs, is more accentuated toward the north, especially in
Epirus. About Corinth also, where Albanian intermixture is common,
the cephalic index rises above 83. The Peloponnesus has probably
best preserved its early dolichocephaly, as we should expect. In
Thessaly alone are the modern Greeks as purely Mediterranean as in
classic times. There can be no doubt that in Asia Minor at least, the
word Greek is devoid of any racial significance. It merely denotes a
man who speaks Greek, or else one who is a Greek Catholic, converted
from Mohammedanism. Greek, like Turk, has become entirely a
matter of language and religion, as these people have intermingled.
Thus in the southwest of Asia Minor, where Semitic influences have
been strong, von Luschan<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> makes the pregnant observation that the
Greeks, in the main, look like Jews and speak Turkish. Here, then, is
proof positive that no Greeks of pure Mediterranean descent remain
to represent the primitive Hellenic type in that region. But it is
equally certain that in the main body of the Greeks at home in Greece,
the original racial traits are still in the ascendant. The smoothly oval
and long faces in our two Greek portraits are surely of Mediterranean
type. To this, the ideal form, the purest elements in the nation still
tend to revert.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the ancients, the modern Greeks are
strongly brunet in all respects. Ornstein ('79) found less than ten per
cent of light hair, although blue and gray eyes were characteristic of
rather more than a quarter of his seventeen hundred and sixty-seven
recruits. This accords with expectation, for among the Albanians,
next neighbors and most intrusive aliens in Greece, light eyes are
quite common. Weisbach's ('82) data confirm this, ninety-six per cent
of his Greeks being pure brunets.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In stature these people are intermediate
between the Turks and the Albanians and Dalmatians, which
latter are among the tallest of Europeans. In facial features Nicolucci's
early opinion seems to be confirmed, that the Greek face is
distinctively orthognathous&mdash;that is to say, with a vertical profile, the
lower parts of the face being neither projecting nor prominent. The
face is generally of a smooth oval, rather narrow and high, especially
as compared with the round-faced Slavs. The nose is thin and high,
perhaps more often finely chiseled and straight in profile. The facial
features seem to be well demonstrated in the classic statuary, although
it is curious, as Stephanos observes, that these ideal heads are distinctly
brachycephalic. Either the ancient sculptors knew little of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a><br /><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
anthropology, or else we have again a confirmation of our assertion
that, however conscious of their peculiar facial traits a people may be,
the head form is a characteristic whose significance is rarely recognized.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Linguistically the pure Slavs in the Balkan states comprise only
the Serbo-Croatians and the Albanians (see map), dividing between
them the ancient territory of Illyria. This western half of the peninsula,
rugged and remote, has been relatively little exposed to the direct
ravages of either Finnic or Turkish invaders. Especially is this true
of Albania. Nearly all authorities since Hahn are agreed in identifying
these latter people&mdash;who call themselves Skipetars, by the way&mdash;as
the modern representatives of the ancient Illyrians. They are
said to have been Slavonized by the Serbo-Croatians, who have been
generally regarded as descendants of the settlers brought by the Emperor
Heraclius from beyond the Save. This he is said to have done in
order to repopulate the lands devastated by the Avars and other Slavs
who, Procopius informs us, first appeared in this region in the sixth
century of our era. The settlers imported by Heraclius came, we are
told, from two distant places: Old Servia, or Sorabia, placed by Freeman
in modern Saxony; and Chrobatia, which, he says, lies in southwestern
Poland. According to this view, the Serbo-Croatians are
an offshoot from the northern Slavs, being divided from them to-day
by the intrusive Hungarians, while the Albanians alone are truly indigenous
to the country.</p>

<p>The recent political fate of these Illyrian peoples has been quite
various, the Albanians alone preserving their independence continually
under the merely nominal rule of the Turks. Religion, also, has
affected these Slavs in various ways. Servia owes much of its present
peace and prosperity to the practical elimination of the Moslems.
Bosnia is still largely Mohammedan, with about a third of its people,
according to White ('86), still professing that religion. The significance
of this is increased, since it was mainly the upper classes in
Bosnia, according to Freeman, who embraced the religion of Islam in
order to preserve their power and estates. The conversion was not
national, as in the case of the Albanians. Thus social and religious
segregation work in harmony to produce discord. With multitudes of
Jews monopolizing the commerce of the country and the people thus
divided socially as well as in religion, the political unrest in Bosnia certainly
seems to require the strong arm of Austrian suzerainty to preserve
order.</p>

<p>Whatever the theory of the historians as to origins may be, to the
anthropologist the modern Illyrians&mdash;Serbo-Croatians and Albanians
alike&mdash;are physically a unit. Two characteristics render this ethnic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
group distinctive: first, that it comprises some of the tallest men in the
world, comparing favorably with the Scotch in this respect; and,
secondly, that the Illyrians tend to be among the broadest-headed
people known. In general, it would appear that the people, of Herzegovina
and northern Albania possess these traits to the most notable
degree, while both in the direction of the Save and Danube and of the
plains of Thessaly and Epirus they have been attenuated by intermixture.
Presumably also toward the east among the Bulgarians in
Macedonia and Thrace these characteristics diminish in intensity.
Thus, for example, while the Herzegovinians, measured by Weisbach,
yielded an average stature of five feet nine inches, the Bosnians were
appreciably shorter; and the Dalmatians and Albanians were even
more so. Nevertheless, as compared with the Greeks, Bulgars, Turks,
or Roumanians, even the shortest of these Slavs stood high. From
this specific center outward, especially around the head of the Adriatic
Sea, over into Venetia, spreads the influence of this giantism. It confirms,
as we have said, the classical theory of an Illyrian cross among
the Venetians, extending well up into the Tyrol.</p>

<p>As for the second trait, the exaggerated broad-headedness, it too,
like the tallness of stature, seems to center about Herzegovina and
Montenegro. Thus at Scutari, in the corner of Albania near this last-named
country, Zampa<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> found a cranial index of 89; in Herzegovina
the index upon the living head ranges above 87. It would be difficult
to exceed this brachycephaly anywhere in the world. The square
foreheads and broad faces of the people correspond in every way to the
shape of the heads. Its significance appears immediately on comparison
with the long oval faces of the Greeks.</p>

<p>One more trait of the Balkan Slavs remains for us to note. The
people are mainly pure brunets, as we might expect, but they seem
to be less dark than either the Greeks or the Turks. Especially among
the Albanians are light traits by no means infrequent. In this respect
the contrast with the Greeks is apparent, as well as with the Dalmatians
along the coast and the Italians in the same latitude across
the Adriatic. Weisbach found nearly ten per cent of blond and red
hair among his Bosnian soldiers, while about one third of the eyes were
either gray or blue. The Herzegovinians are even lighter than the
Bosnians, almost as much so as the Albanians. From consideration
of these facts it would appear as if the harsh climate of these upland
districts had been indeed influential in setting off the inland peoples
from the Italian-speaking Dalmatians along the coast. For among
the latter brunetness certainly increases from north to south,
conformably to the general rule for the rest of Europe. In the interior,
blondness apparently moves in the contrary direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
culminating in the mountain fastnesses of northern Albania and the
vicinity. On the whole, we find also in this trait of brunetness competent
evidence to connect these Illyrians with the great body of the
Alpine race farther to the west. We have another illustration of
its determined predilection for a mountainous habitat, in which it
stoutly resists all immigrant tendencies toward variation from its
primitive type.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Osmanli Turks, who politically dominate the Balkan Peninsula,
notwithstanding their numerical insignificance, are mainly distinctive
among their neighbors by reason of their speech and religion.
Turkish is the westernmost representative of a great group of languages,
best known, perhaps, as the Ural-Altaic family.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This comprises
all those of northern Asia even to the Pacific Ocean, together
with that of the Finns in Russian Europe. Its members are by no
means unified physically. All varieties of type are included within its
boundaries, from the tall and blond one which we may call Finnic,
prevalent about the Baltic; to the squat and swarthy Kalmucks and
Kirghez, to whom we have in a physical sense applied the term Mongols.
The Turkish branch of this great family of languages is to-day
represented in eastern Europe by two peoples, whom we may roughly
distinguish as Turks and Tatars.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The term Tatar, it should be observed,
is entirely of European invention, like the similar word Hungarian.
The only name recognized by the Osmanli themselves is
that of Turk. This, by the way, seems quite aptly to be derived from
a native root meaning "brigand," according to Chantre. They
apply the word Tatar solely to the north Asiatic barbarians. By
general usage this latter term, Tatar, has to-day become more specifically
applied by ethnologists to the scattered peoples of Asiatic descent
and Turkish speech who are mainly to be found in Russia and Asia
Minor.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the two principal physical types to-day comprised within the
limits of the Ural-Altaic languages, the Turks and Tatars seem to be
affiliated with the Mongol rather than the Finn, not physically alone,
but in respect of language as well. As a matter of fact, they are racially
nearer the Aryan-speaking Europeans than most people imagine, in
everything except their speech. Their nearest relatives in Asia seem
to be the Turkoman peoples, who, to the number of a million or more,
inhabit the deserts and steppes of western Asia. It was from somewhere
about this latter region, as we know, that the hordes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a><br /><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
Huns under Attila, and those of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, set
forth to the devastation of Europe. The physical type of these inhabitants
of Turkestan has been fairly well established by anthropologists.
It persists throughout a great multitude of tribes of various
names, among whom the Kara-Kirghez, Uzbegs, and Kiptchaks are
prominent.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> On page 625 we have portraits of these Turkoman
types. The most noticeable feature of the portraits is the absence
of purely Mongol facial characteristics. Except in the Kara-Kirghez
the features are distinctly European. There is no squint-eye; the nose
is well formed; the cheek bones are not prominent, although the faces
are broad; and, most important of all, the beard is abundantly developed,
both in the Uzbeg and the Kiptchak. The Kara-Kirghez, on
the other hand, betrays unmistakably his Mongol derivation in every
one of these important respects. One common trait is possessed by
all three&mdash;to wit, extreme brachycephaly, with an index ranging from
85 to 89. The flatness of the occiput is very noticeable in our portraits
in every case, giving what Hamy calls a "cuboid aspect" to
the skull. These portraits, if typical, should be enough to convince
us that the Turkoman of the steppes about the Aral and Caspian Seas
is far from being a pure Mongol even in his native land, although a
strain of Mongol blood is apparent in many of their tribes.</p>

<p>The fact is that the Asiatic Turkomans, whence our Osmanli
Turks are derived, are a highly composite type. A very important
element in their composition is that of certain brachycephalic peoples
of the Pamir, the Galchas and mountain Tadjiks. These are for
all practical purposes identical with the Alpine type of western Europe.
In their accentuated brachycephaly, their European facial features,
their abundance of wavy hair and beard, and finally in their
intermediate color of hair and eyes,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> these latter peoples in the Pamir
resemble their European prototypes, or perhaps we had better say,
congeners. So close is this affiliation that the occurrence of this type
in western Asia is the keystone in any argument for the Asiatic origin
of the Alpine race of Europe. The significance of it for us in this
connection is that it explains the European affinity of many of the
Turkoman tribes, who are more strongly European than Mongol in
their resemblances. It is highly important, we affirm, to fix this in
mind, for the prevalent opinion seems to be that the Turks in Europe
have departed widely from their ancestral Asiatic type, because of
their present lack of Mongol characteristics, such as almond eyes, lank
black hair, flat noses, and high cheek bones.</p>

<p>Either the Osmanli Turks were never Mongols, or they have lost
every trace of it by intermixture. Our portraits on the opposite page
give little indication of Asiatic derivation except in their accentuated
short-and broad-headedness. This is considerably more noticeable in
Asia Minor than in European Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> West of the Bosporus the
Turks differ but little from the surrounding Slavs in head form. They
have been bred down from their former extreme brachycephaly,
which still rules to a greater degree in Asia Minor. In our portraits
from this region the absence of occipital prominence is very marked.
In addition to this, the Turks are everywhere, as Chantre observes,
"incontestably brunet." The hair is generally stiff and straight.
The beard is full. This latter trait is fatal to any assumption of a persistence
of Kirghez blood, or of any Mongolic extraction, in fact. The
nose is broad, but straight in profile. The eyes are perfectly normal,
the oblique Mongol type no more frequent than elsewhere. In
stature tallness is the rule, judging by Chantre's data, but in this respect
social conditions are undoubtedly of great effect. On the whole,
then, we may consider that the Turks have done fairly well in the
preservation of their primitive characteristics. Chantre especially
finds them quite homogeneous, considering all the circumstances.
They vary according to the people among whom their lot is cast.
Among the Armenians they become broader-headed, while among the
Iranian peoples&mdash;Kurds or Persians&mdash;the opposite influence of intermixture
at once is apparent.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians are of interest because of their traditional Finnic
origin and subsequent Europeanization. This has ensued through
conversion to Christianity and the adoption of a Slavic speech. Our
earliest mention of these Bulgars would seem to locate them between
the Ural Mountains and the Volga.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The district was, in fact, known
as Old Bulgaria till the Russians took it in the fifteenth century. As
to which of the many existing tribes of the Volga Finns represent the
ancestors of these Bulgarians, no one is, I think, competent to speak.
Pruner Bey seems to think they were the Ostiaks and Voguls, since
emigrated across the Urals into Asia; the still older view of Edwards
and Klaproth made them Huns; Ob&eacute;d&eacute;nare, according to Virchow,
said they were Samoyeds or Tungus; while Howorth and
Beddoe claim the honor for the Chuvashes. These citations are
enough to prove that nobody knows very much about it in detail. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>
that can be affirmed is that a tribe of Finnic-speaking people crossed
the Danube toward the end of the seventh century and possessed themselves
of territory near its mouth. Remaining heathen for two hundred
odd years, they finally adopted Christianity and under their
great leaders, Simeon and Samuel, became during the tenth century
a power in the land. Their rulers, styling themselves "Emperors of
the Slavs," fought the Germans; conquered the Magyars as well as
their neighbors in Thrace, receiving tribute from Byzantium; became
allies of Charlemagne; and then subsided under the rule of the Turks.
Since the practical demise of this latter power they have again taken
courage, and in their semi-political independence in Bulgaria and
northern Roumelia rejoice in an ever-rich and growing literature
and sense of nationality.</p>

<p>Bulgarian is spoken, as our map at page 614 indicates, far outside
the present political limits of the principality&mdash;indeed, over about two
thirds of European Turkey. Gopc&#780;evi&#263; has made a brilliant attempt to
prove that Macedonia, shown by our map and commonly believed to
be at bottom Bulgarian, is in reality populated mainly by Serbs.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The
weakness of this contention was speedily laid bare by his critics. Political
motives, especially the ardent desire of the Servians to make good
a title to Macedonia before the disruption of the Ottoman Empire, can
scarcely be denied. Servia needs an outlet on the Mediterranean too
obviously to cloak such an attempted ethnic usurpation. As a fact,
Macedonia, even before the late Greco-Turkish war, was in a sad state
of anarchy. The purest Bulgarian is certainly spoken in the Rhodope
Mountains; there are many Roumanians of Latin speech; the Greeks
predominate all along the sea and throughout the three-toed peninsula
of Salonica, while the Turks are sparsely disseminated everywhere.
And as for religion&mdash;well, besides the severally orthodox
Greeks and Turks, there are in addition the Moslem and apostate Bulgarians,
known as Pomaks, who have nothing in common with their
Greek Catholic fellow-Bulgars, together with the scattering Pindus
Roumanians and Albanians in addition. This interesting field of
ethnographic investigation is, even at this late day, practically unworked.
As Dr. Beddoe writes&mdash;and his remarks are equally applicable
to Americans&mdash;"here are fine opportunities for any enterprising
Englishman with money and a taste for travel and with sufficient
brains to be able to pick up a language. But, alas! such men
usually seem to care for nothing but 'killing something.'"</p>

<p>The Roumanians, or Moldo-Wallachians, are not confined within
the limits of that country alone. Their language and nationality
cover not only the plains along the Danube and the Black Sea, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
their speech extends beyond the Carpathian Mountains over the entire
southeastern quarter of Hungary and up into the Bukovina. Transylvania
is merely a German and Magyar islet in the vast extent of the
Roumanian nation. There are more than a third as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
Roumanians as there are Magyars in the Hungarian kingdom, according to
the census of 1890. Politically it thus happens that these people are
pretty well split up in their allegiance. Nor can this condition be
other than permanent. For the Carpathian Mountains, in their great
circle about the Hungarian basin, cut directly through the middle of
the nation as measured by language. This curious circumstance can
be accounted for only on the supposition that the disorder in the
direction of the Balkan Peninsula, incident upon the Turkish invasion,
forced the growing nation to expand toward the northwest, even
over the natural barrier interposed between Roumania proper and
Hungary. Geographical law, more powerful than human will, ordains
that this latter natural area of characterization&mdash;the great plain
basin of Hungary&mdash;should be the seat of a single political unit.
There is no resource but that the Roumanians should in Hungary accept
the division from their fellows over the mountains as final for all
political purposes.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The native name of these people is Vlach, Wallach, or Wallachian.
Various origins for the name have been assigned. Lejean
asserts that it designates a nomad shepherd, in distinction
from a tiller of the soil or a dweller in towns. Picot voices the
native view as to ethnic origins by deriving the word Wallach from
the same root as Wales, Walloon, etc., applied by the Slavs and Germans
to the Celtic peoples as "foreigners." This theory is now generally
discountenanced. Ob&eacute;d&eacute;nare's attempt to prove such a Celtic
relationship has met with little favor.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The western name Roumanian
springs from a similarly exploded hypothesis concerning the
Latin origin of these people. To be sure, Roumanian is distinctly
allied to the other Romance languages in structure. It is an anomaly
in the eastern Slavic half of Europe. The most plausible explanation
for this phenomenon, and one long accepted, was that the modern
Roumanians were descendants of the two hundred and forty thousand
colonists whom the Emperor Trajan is said to have sent into the
conquered province of Dacia. The earlier inhabitants of the territory
were believed to have been the original Thracians. Since no two
were agreed as to what the Thracians were like, this did not amount
to much. Modern common sense has finally prevailed over attempts
to display philological erudition in such matters. Freeman expresses
this clearly. Roumania, as he says, lay directly in the pathway of
all invasions from the East; the hold of the Romans upon Dacia was
never firm; the province was the first to break away from the empire;
and finally proof of a Latinization only at the late date of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
thirteenth century is not wanting. The truth seems to be that two forces
were contending for the control of eastern Europe. The Latin could
prevail only in those regions which were beyond the potent influence
of Greece. Dacia being remote and barbarian, this Latin element
had a fighting chance for survival, and succeeded.</p>

<p>Our ethnic map at page 614 shows a curious islet of Roumanian
language in the heart of the Greek-speaking territory of Thessaly.
There is little sympathy between the two peoples, according to Hell&egrave;ne.
The occurrence of this Roumanian colony, so far removed
from its base, has long puzzled ethnographers. Some believe the
peoples were separately Romanized <i>in situ</i>; others that they were
colonists from Dacia in the ninth and tenth centuries. At all events,
these Pindus Roumanians are too numerous&mdash;over a million souls&mdash;to
be neglected in any theory as to the origin of their language.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Another
islet of quasi-Roumanian speech occurs in Istria, on the Adriatic
coast. Its origin is equally obscure.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>It is no contradiction that, in spite of the fact of our exclusion
of Roumania from the Balkan Peninsula owing to its Latin affinities,
thereby seeming to differentiate it sharply from Bulgaria, the latter
of Finnic origin; that we now proceed to treat of the physical characteristics
of the two nationalities, Roumanian and Bulgarian, together.
Here is another example of the superficiality of language,
of social and political institutions. They do not concern the fundamental
physical facts of race in the least. At the same time we again
emphasize the necessity of a powerful corrective, based upon purely
natural phenomena, for the tendency of philologists and ethnographers
to follow their pet theories far afield, giving precedence to
analogies of language and customs over all the potent facts of geographical
probability. Let us look at it in this light. Is there any
chance that, on the opposite sides of the Danube, a few Finns and a
few Romans respectively interposed among the dense population
which so fertile an area must have possessed, even at an early time,
could be in any wise competent to make different types of the two?
There is nothing in our confessedly scanty anthropological data to
show it, at all events. We must treat the lower Danubian plain as
a unit, irrespective of the bounds of language, religion, or nationality.</p>

<p>It was long believed that the Bulgarians were distinctive among
the other peoples of eastern Europe by reason of their long-headedness.
All the investigations upon limited series of crania pointed in
that direction. This naturally was interpreted as a confirmation of the
historic data as to a Finnic Bulgarian origin very distinct from that
of the broad-headed Slavs. Several recent discoveries have put a
new face upon the matter. In the first place, researches by Dr. Bassanovitch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
of Varna, upon several thousand recruits from western Bulgaria
prove that in the west these Bulgarians even outdo many of the
Balkan Slavs in their broad-headedness.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> At the same time it appears
that the older authorities were right, after all, in respect of the
eastern Bulgarians. Among them, and also over in eastern Roumelia,
long heads are still the rule. The oval-faced Bulgarians
among our portraits are probably of this dolichocephalic type.
Their contrast facially with the broad-headed Roumanians is very
marked. Thus it is established that the Bulgarian nation is by no
means a unit in its head form. We should add also that, although not
definitely proved as yet, it is highly probable that similar variations
occur in Roumania. In the Bukovina brachycephaly certainly prevails.
Our square-faced Roumanians on page 621 may presumably
be taken to represent this type. This broad-headedness decreases
apparently toward the east as we leave the Carpathian Mountains,
until along the Black Sea it seems, as in Bulgaria, to give way to a
real dolichocephaly.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>How are we to account for the occurrence of so extended an area
of long-headedness all over the great lower Danubian plain? Our
study of the northern Slavs has shown that no such phenomenon
occurs there among the Russians. It certainly finds no counterpart
among the southern Slavs or the Turks. The only other people who
resemble these Bulgars in long-headedness are the Greeks. Even
they are far separated; and, in any event, but very impure representatives
of the type. What shall we say? Two explanations seem to be
possible, as Dr. Beddoe observes.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Either this dolichocephaly is due
to the Finnicism of the original Bulgars, or else it represents a characteristic
of the pre-Bulgarian population of the Danube basin. He
inclines with moderation to the former view. The other horn of the
dilemma is chosen by Anutchin<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> in a brilliant paper at the late Anthropological
Congress at Moscow. According to his view&mdash;and we
assent most heartily to it&mdash;this dolichocephaly along the Black Sea
represents the last survival of a most persistent trait of the primitive
inhabitants of eastern Europe. Referring again to our study of
Russia,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> we would call attention to the occurrence of a similar long-headed
race underlying all the modern Slavic population. We are
able to prove also that such a primitive substratum occurs over nearly
all Europe. It has been unearthed not far from here, for example,
at Glasinac in Bosnia. When arch&aelig;ological research is extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
farther to the east, new light upon this point may be expected. It will
be asked at once why this primitive population should still lie bare
upon the surface, here along the lower Danube, when it has been
submerged everywhere else in Central Europe. Our answer is ready.
Here in this rich alluvial plain population might, expectedly, be
dense at a very early period. As we have observed before, such a
population, if solidly massed, opposes an enormous resistance to absorption
by new-comers. A few thousand Bulgarian invaders would
be a mere drop in the bucket of such an aggregation of men. We
are strengthened in this hypothesis that the dolichocephaly of the
Danubian plain is primitive, by reason of another significant fact
brought out by Bassanovitch.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Long-headedness is overwhelmingly
more prevalent among women than among men. The former represent
more often what Bassanovitch calls the "dolichocephalic Thracian
type." The oval-faced Bulgarian woman among our portraits
would seem to be one of these. Now, in our treatment of the Jews,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
we have sought to illustrate the principle that in any population the
primitive type persists more often in the women. The bearing of
such a law in the case of the Bulgars would seem to be definite. Their
long-headedness, where it occurs, must date from a far more remote
period than the historic advent of the few thousand immigrants who
have given the name Bulgaria to the country.</p>

<p>As for the other physical traits of the Bulgarians and Roumanians
there is little to be added. It goes without saying that they are both
deep brunets. Ob&eacute;d&eacute;nare says the Roumanians are very difficult
to distinguish from the modern Spaniards and Italians. This is probably
true in respect of brunetness. The Oriental cast of features of
our portraits, on the other hand, can not fail to attract attention.
More than two thirds of Bassanovitch's nineteen hundred and fifty-five
Bulgarians were very dark-haired. Light eyes were of course
more frequent, nearly forty per cent being classed as blue or greenish.
A few&mdash;about five per cent&mdash;were yellow or tawny-haired, these individuals
being at the same time blue-eyed. This was probably Procopius's
excuse for the assertion that the Bulgars were of fair complexion.
He also affirmed that they were of goodly stature. This is
not true of either the modern Roumanians or Bulgars. They average
less than five feet five inches in height,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> being considerably shorter
than the Turks, and positively diminutive beside the Bosnians and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
other southern Slavs. The Bulgarians especially are correspondingly
stocky, heavily boned and built. We may also affirm a real difference
in temperament between the two nationalities, built up, as we assert,
from the same foundation. The Wallachians are said to be more emotional
and responsive; the Bulgarians inclined to heaviness and stolidity.
Both are pre-eminently industrious and contented cultivators
of the soil, with little aptitude for commerce, so it is said. We hesitate
to pass judgment upon either in respect of their further aptitudes
until fuller data can be provided than are available at the present time.</p>

<h2>MARVELOUS INCREASE IN PRODUCTION OF GOLD.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By ALEXANDER E. OUTERBRIDGE, Jr.</span></p>


<p>The increasing annual production of gold in the world is a matter
of such far-reaching economic importance, not only in the financial
affairs of nations, but also in their industrial progress and in their
civilization, that a vast amount of patient study has been given by
eminent statisticians to the subject, and much time expended in compiling,
from various historical records and other sources of information,
statistical data which can be confidently accepted as approximately
correct, showing the annual production of the precious metal
from the time of the discovery of America down to the present day.</p>

<p>A publication of the United States Treasury Department, issued
in 1897, containing information respecting the production of precious
metals, etc., gives statistical tables showing the annual production of
gold in the world, commencing with the year 1493. The earlier
records are taken from a table of averages for certain periods compiled
by Dr. Adolph Soetbeer, and the later figures (from 1885 to
1896) are the annual estimates of the Bureau of the Mint. Other
tables show the annual production of gold from the mines of
the United States alone from 1845 to 1896, and it is from these
official sources mainly that the information has been gathered for this
article, supplemented, however, by a full and very interesting communication
to the author from the Director of the Mint, giving the
latest figures, not yet published, and containing the estimates and deductions
of the director respecting the production of gold in the world
in 1898. This information is so timely and valuable that the author
is of the opinion that the courteous letter of the Director of the Mint
in response to his inquiries, if appended to this article, may prove to
be&mdash;like the postscript of a lady's correspondence&mdash;its most important
feature.</p>

<p>Students of political economy are well aware of the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
some theorists have maintained that the annual production of gold in
the world (apart from the phenomenal discoveries in California about
the middle of the century, which were of an ephemeral character)
does not keep pace with the natural increase in trade requirements, if
gold is to maintain its position as the standard measure of value and
the universal medium of exchange. This theory, after having passed
through the various stages of <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> argument in academic theses,
became the "war cry" of a political party in this country composed
of heterogeneous elements in the community, all inspired with one
common idea that the balance of power in commercial transactions
had been destroyed by the overwhelming force of concentration of
capital and the "cornering" of the visible supply of gold in the world
by a few enormously wealthy bankers. It was shown that, while
the average annual production of gold in the world in five years
from 1855 to 1860 exceeded $134,000,000, there was a constant
decline thereafter, so that the annual average during five years from
1881 to 1885 barely exceeded $99,000,000, according to official estimates;
also that the annual gold product of the mines of the United
States declined from a value of $65,000,000 in 1853 to $33,000,000
in 1892. Furthermore, although a rising tendency was observed in
each subsequent year, the production from the mines of this country
in 1894 was still under $40,000,000, as was shown by the statistics of
the United States Treasury Department.</p>

<p>While admitting the general accuracy of these statements of fact,
it is the purpose of this paper to endeavor to show that the conclusions
drawn therefrom were entirely fallacious, because due cognizance was
not taken of the wonderful progress that has been made in recent years
in mining and metallurgical arts whereby countless millions of tons
of ore containing gold in such a finely divided state, or in such a refractory
condition, that it was formerly worthless (costing more to
recover the gold than the value of the precious metal contained in
the ore), have now rendered these low-grade ores the most stable
sources of supply of gold. Metallurgists, having knowledge of these
facts, have at various times during the past ten years predicted that a
golden stream would soon begin to flow from these practically new
and apparently inexhaustible sources; but the people at large were
wholly incredulous, and they are now astounded at the magnitude of
the production of gold in the world in the past two years; and more
especially, perhaps, are they amazed at the increase of production in
the United States, as shown by the official reports of the Director of
the Mint.</p>

<p>The gold production of the world in 1897 amounted in value, according
to the most reliable estimates, to more than $237,000,000,
and in 1898 to more than $280,000,000; and it is the opinion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
Director of the Mint that the final compilation of figures will show
that the production was "somewhere between $290,000,000 and
$300,000,000!"</p>

<p>The above table, showing the estimated production of gold
from all parts of the world in 1897 and 1898, is abstracted from the
Annual Statistical Number of the Engineering and Mining Journal
(January 1, 1899), and, although these figures may differ somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
from those of the Director of the Mint, and from the final compilations,
they are believed to be not very far from truth.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the principal countries contributing to the
grand total in both years were Africa, the United States of America,
Australasia, Russia, Canada, Mexico, and India, the names being
given in the order of the respective importance of these countries as
gold producers in 1898.</p>

<p>It may surprise many readers to observe that India is placed at
the foot of the list, for we are accustomed to associate India with gold,
Mexico with silver, and Russia with platinum; and it may also
prove a surprise to find that the contribution of the Klondike region,
which has created such a great sensation, is so trifling as compared to
the grand total. In 1897 the Klondike was credited with an output
of less than $3,000,000, and in 1898 of a little over $10,000,000.</p>

<p>It will be observed in the estimates of the Government's agents
(January 1, 1899) of the production of gold in the United States for
1898 (see the letter of the Director of the Mint, appended hereto) that
the gold production of the State of Colorado was more than twice that
of the Klondike region, and the production of California was nearly
fifty per cent greater than that of the Klondike.</p>

<p>Other surprising facts crop out in studying in detail the increasing
production of gold, more especially in the United States. For example,
California has always been regarded as pre-eminently the gold-giving
State, and until 1897 she led all the other States in the value
of gold annually produced. Colorado, on the other hand, was equally
famous as a silver-producing State, and while still holding this leading
position she has actually passed California in the production of gold.
Colorado has thus taken the lead over all the States in the production
of gold and silver.</p>

<p>The output of gold in the United States in 1898 was more than
twice that of 1890; and the production of gold in the world in 1898, at
the lowest estimate, was much more than twice the estimated production
in 1890. In the decade just prior to the California gold discoveries,
in 1849, the average annual production in the world is estimated
to have been less than $13,500,000. In the previous decade it
was less than $10,000,000. Assuming these figures of Dr. Adolph
Soetbeer (which are accepted by the nations of the world, and incorporated
in many official documents) to be approximately correct, it
appears that the estimated production of gold in the world in the first
third of the present century was but little more than the production
in the single year 1898!</p>

<p>It is, indeed, difficult to comprehend the full significance of these
figures at a glance: the production of gold in the past five years has
amounted to more than $1,100,000,000; and if production should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
increase during the next five years in anything like the ratio of the
past five years, it may be that a new economic problem, the very
antithesis of that alluded to in the commencement of this paper, may
present itself for solution. At all events, the cry of the Populists and
others that increasing scarcity of gold is the cause of much of the poverty
and of other ills of mankind, must surely be drowned in the
golden stream now flowing from all quarters of the globe, almost
threatening to become a rushing torrent, dangerous to the stable foundations
of the world's commerce. That this, however, fortunately is
an imaginary danger will appear from the following arguments:</p>

<p>Modern gold-getting by scientific methods compels the permanent
investment of an enormous amount of capital, and a moderate return
only in dividend is looked for as a rule; thus the balance between
acquisition and disbursement is likely to be maintained in the future.</p>

<p>One of the chief causes of the extraordinary increase of production
in very recent years is to be found in the application of the "cyanide
process" to the recovery of gold from "tailings." This process is
also largely applied to obtaining gold from very low-grade ores, that,
in some cases, contain an average of less than one quarter of an ounce
of gold distributed throughout a ton of ore! At the present time
there are about twenty-five cyanide plants in this country, and over
forty in the Transvaal, where the process has received its greatest development.</p>

<p>Although the fact that cyanide of potassium would dissolve gold
quite readily was known long ago, having been employed by Faraday
in his experiments with thin films of transparent gold, and used very
extensively in the making of solutions of gold for electroplating baths
during fifty years past, the practical application of the solvent to obtaining
gold from low-grade ores is less than ten years old.</p>

<p>In Utah there is a dry bed of an ancient lake, the floor of which
may be said to be carpeted with gold; according to a recent report this
bed of limestone, eight miles by ten, varying from twenty to forty feet
in thickness, and containing gold in proportion running from six to
twenty dollars per ton, is an "ideal ore" for treatment by the cyanide
process. A number of cyanide mills are now working the deposit, all
paying dividends, and it is said that the only limit to output is the
capacity of the mills. It is estimated that there are "5,000,000,000
tons of ore in the district, containing $50,000,000,000 worth of
gold!" Although this statement is startling, the estimate is not a wild
guess, for the blanket of ore has been cut in many places; hundreds
of samples have been taken from different depths, and in all cases the
finely distributed gold has been found, apparently having been deposited
from solution in a mineral water which formed the lake in prehistoric
times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span></p>

<p>A similar deposit of silver was found in New Mexico about twenty
years ago and was christened the "Silver Lake" Mine. This was
worked profitably until the great fall in price of silver made the
operation a losing one. The "blanket" still contains millions of
ounces of silver, and it is probable that cheaper methods of recovering
the metal from the ore will be devised whenever the price of silver
shall have fallen low enough to enable it to take its place among the
so-called "economic" metals, having far wider application in the arts
than have the precious metals. At present silver holds an unfortunate
place "betwixt and between" the precious and the economic
metals.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago aluminum was more valuable than silver is to-day,
and its production was correspondingly limited. Last year the
price was reduced to a point which so widely extended its use that
the production increased from 1,900 pounds in 1888 to more than
5,000,000 in 1898.</p>

<p>Although the gold deposit in the Camp Floyd district in Utah already
alluded to may actually contain several billions of dollars' worth
of gold, it will cost some billions of dollars' worth of labor and capital
to recover the precious metal and will consume much time in the
process; so that there is little reason to fear that gold will become so
plentiful on account of this discovery that it will cease to be regarded
as a precious metal. About forty years ago the assayers of the United
States Mint announced that the clay underlying the city of Philadelphia
contained more gold than had been brought from California
and Australia, and this remarkable statement has never been disproved
or even questioned. The gold, however, still remains locked fast in
the clay, and the value of the precious metal has not yet fallen in consequence
of the announcement of this old discovery. At that time the
idea of profitably recovering gold from low-grade ores had not been
born, and it is an interesting fact to note that in California gold is now
being obtained from clay (by hydraulic washing methods) in which
there is but little more than the average proportion of gold to the ton
that the assayers found in the clay under the streets of Philadelphia.
This does not prove, however, that it will now pay to excavate under
the streets of the Quaker City, and undermine the buildings in
order to wash out this gold, and until Philadelphia shall be provided
with a far more copious water supply the most sanguine or suave promoter
of great undertakings would find it impossible to obtain subscriptions
to any scheme to recover this fugitive gold, or even, perhaps,
difficult to give away shares of stock to influential individuals either
in or out of councils.</p>

<p>An impression has prevailed that the production of gold in South
Africa attained its maximum point in 1897, and that thenceforth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>
animal output would be smaller. On account of this fear the
"Kaffirs" (South African gold-mining stocks) suffered a decline in
the London stock market some months ago, but the statistics showed
that the output during the first half of 1898 was larger than in the
previous half year, and in the latter months of the year the increase
was even more pronounced.</p>

<p>In an address given before the Mining and Metallurgical Section
of the Franklin Institute on Mining and Minting of Gold and Silver
in November last, the writer said that the production of gold in South
Africa in 1898 would not fall far short of $70,000,000, and would
probably be nearer $80,000,000. The estimate of the Director of the
Mint fixes the amount almost at the latter figure. The United States,
in spite of the considerable increase over 1897, takes second place as a
world's producer of gold, Africa having contributed in 1898 an
amount equal to that of the United States and Canada (including the
Klondike) combined.</p>

<p>The startling announcements of discoveries of virgin gold in the
Klondike and of rich placer gold deposits in other localities have had
little to do with the enormous increase in production of gold in the
world in recent years, though formerly such discoveries constituted the
main source of supply of the precious metal. Digging for nuggets is a
lottery pure and simple, in which a few prizes are obtained and many
losses are suffered. It is said that for every dollar in gold taken out of
the Klondike to date, two dollars have been carried in, and this is perhaps
a conservative estimate. In fact, it is easy to prove by figures, if
the value of labor be counted even at the lowest wage rate, say one
dollar per diem, that far more money has been lost by the many gold-seekers
than has been gained by the few fortunate ones in this twentieth-century
search for the golden fleece.</p>

<p>The business of extracting gold from low-grade ores by scientific
methods on a large scale, where the precious metal is evenly distributed
throughout the matrix or gangue, is a legitimate field for the
investment of capital, because the element of chance is reduced to a
minimum, and even may be eliminated altogether. The margin of
profit per ton of ore is not large as a rule in these operations, and thus
the stability of value of the product is assured, whatever the output
may be.</p>

early day available, comparing it with the gold output of the same
countries in 1897. And first of the United States:</p>

<p>"Inclosed you will find an estimate made by the agents of the
bureau of the gold yield of the several States and Territories in 1898.
The aggregate outturn was $65,782,667. It must be clearly borne
in mind that this is only an <i>estimate</i>, not the ascertained actual
production. In 1897 the gold product of the United States
was $57,363,000. Assuming the estimate of the gold product of
the United States in 1898 to be correct, there was an increase
in the latter year over the gold yield of 1897, in round numbers, of
$8,420,000.</p>

<p>"The gold product of the Witwatersrand in 1898 was 4,295,602
ounces crude, and of the whole of the South African Republic
4,555,009 ounces crude, representing a value of $79,801,025.</p>

<p>"As the gold product of the Transvaal in 1897 was $57,633,861,
the increase in 1898 was $22,167,164. The figures here given are
those published in all the leading papers interested in such matters
in England and on the European continent. They are not,
any more than the figures given below, official to the Bureau of
the Mint.</p>

<p>"I have not yet seen any figures of the total gold product of Australia
in 1898, but the output of five out of the seven colonies has been
published. The figures are as follows:</p>

<p>"There was an increase in the gold product of these five colonies
of $13,107,910, the ounce crude averaging about $19 in value. The
total gold product of Australia in 1898 was, as I estimate it, about
$67,792,000. In 1897 it was $55,684,182. As yet no figures of the
gold output of the two Australian colonies&mdash;Tasmania and South
Australia&mdash;have come under my observation.</p>

<p>"Persons not connected with the bureau, but whose opinions are
entitled to respect, have estimated the increase in India's gold output
in 1898 at about $500,000, and in that of Canada (including the
Klondike) at $8,000,000. I have thus far no data on which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>

<h2>THE CALIFORNIA PENAL SYSTEM.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By CHARLES HOWARD SHINN.</span></p>


<p>Theoretically every new commonwealth in organizing
its institutions can measurably avoid the errors of older communities,
and can venture upon promising experiments elsewhere untried.
In practice, however, new States are usually compelled to face
unforeseen difficulties, and although their various departments gain
something in flexibility, they lose in systematic organization. They
have the faults as well as the virtues of the pioneer.</p>

<p>Penology, like every other department of human thought, is a
battlefield of opposing principles. But I know of nothing in print
more inspiring to the officers of the State engaged in prison and reform
work than Herbert Spencer's Essay on Prison Ethics. It is likely
that many of the people who should read it are not aware of its value
and interest to themselves. Beginning at the foundations, Mr. Spencer
makes a lucid exposition of the necessity of "a perpetual readjustment
of the compromise between the ideal and the practicable in
social arrangements." As he points out, gigantic errors are always
made when abstract ethics are ignored.</p>

<p>If society has the right of self-protection, it has, as Mr. Spencer
asserts, the right to coerce a criminal. It has authority to demand
restitution as far as possible, and to restrict the action of the offender
as much as is needful to prevent further aggressions. Beyond this
point absolute morality countenances no restraint and no punishment.
The criminal does not lose all his social rights, but only such
portion of those rights as can not be left him without danger to the
welfare of the community.</p>

<p>But absolute morality also requires that while living in durance
the offender must continue to maintain himself. It is as much his
business to earn his own living as it was before. All that he can
rightfully ask of society is that he be given an opportunity to work,
and to exchange the products of his labor for the necessaries of life.
He has no right to eat the bread of idleness, and to still further tax
the community against which he has committed an aggression. "On
this self-maintenance equity sternly insists." If he is supported by
the taxpayers the breach between himself and the true social order is
indefinitely widened.</p>

<p>Such principles as these could easily have been made a fundamental
part of the California prison system when the State was organized,
for the famous Code of Reform and Prison Discipline, prepared
about 1826 by a New Orleans lawyer, Edward Livingston, was well
known to some of the ablest men of pioneer California, and a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
effort was made to obtain its adoption in complete form. That remarkable
code known as the Livingston system agrees with the
Spencerian principles of ethics, and has been a source of inspiration
for the most advanced penal legislation of recent years. Louisiana
adopted it only in part, but Belgium has the Livingston code in its
entirety. California, suffering under difficult local conditions, took a
course in the liberal pioneer days
that has for a time rendered progress
along the lines of modern development
extremely difficult.</p>

</div>

<p>California is a large and populous
State, many portions of
which are thinly settled and hard
to reach. In early days it had
many Spanish and Mexican outlaws,
and became a refuge for
criminals from all parts of the
world. When the State was organized,
money was extremely
abundant, and every one had
golden dreams. The idea of self-supporting
prisons seemed absurd,
not only because the rich
young State seemed capable of
supporting any expense, but also
because no manufactures were yet
established, and the most active penologist would have found it hard
to find suitable employment for prisoners.</p>

<p>As time went on, the very strong labor unions of California, aided
by many newspapers and politicians, accepted the principle that every
dollar a convict earned was taken from some citizen, and that the State
was bound to support its criminals in idleness. Numbers of good and
earnest men in the service of the State as prison commissioners, wardens,
and other officials studying methods elsewhere and mindful of
local conditions, have made untiring efforts to stir the public conscience,
and to gain recognition of a criminal's right to earn his own
living by productive labor. As long ago as 1872 Hon. E. T. Crane,
of Alameda County, chairman of a joint Assembly and Senate committee,
made an excellent and progressive report on prison reforms.
Something has been gained since then, and, though working under
adverse conditions, the prisons have been excellently managed. But
these results are due to individuals, not to the system, nor to the well-meant
but often injurious enactments of legislatures meeting biennially
for only sixty days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the system of biennial State appropriations, nearly all institutions
suffer at times from mistaken kindness, and at other times
from undue parsimony. Since there is no general supervising board
for the two State prisons and the two State reform schools, and no
settled ratio of appropriation based upon the number of inmates, the
friends of each institution naturally do their best to obtain as large
appropriations as possible from each new legislature. Hence arise
special visiting committees and combinations between legislators
from different parts of the State to "take care of" institutions whose
regular annual income should not be dependent in the least upon
politics.</p>

<p>The appropriations made by the last two legislatures for all purposes
connected with prisons and reform schools, including salaries
of officials, are shown in the following table:</p>

</table></div>
<p>Some small appropriations for improvements are necessarily included
in these totals, but nothing more than may be expected every
year or two. It is proper to rate the average annual expense of these
institutions at nearly half a million dollars, nor can this sum be
materially reduced until the State accepts the fundamental principle
that prisons should be made nearly or quite self-supporting.</p>

<p>San Quentin was once managed to some extent on the contract
system. Furniture-makers and other manufacturers paid half a dollar
a day for each convict employed, and at one time as many as
eight hundred men were thus utilized, giving the prison an income
of twenty-four hundred dollars a week. The system was so violently
attacked by labor unions that it was finally abandoned, and now I am
told that convict-made furniture, stoves, and other articles such as
were formerly made at San Quentin are brought to California from
Joliet, Illinois, and other places by the carload.</p>

<p>Having abandoned the contract system, the State decided to
make jute bags, chiefly for grain, and to sell them as nearly as possible
at cost direct to the consumers, so as to help the agricultural
classes. Machinery costing $400,000 was obtained in England, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
after many difficulties a factory was established at San Quentin. The
price of raw material fluctuates greatly, and the mill has sometimes
lost money, sometimes made a somewhat nominal profit. During the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1891, for instance, 2,574,254 pounds of
goods were manufactured at a total operating expense of $160,684.07,
and were sold at a price which nominally gave $40,275.07 profit.
But no sinking fund was allowed for, to cover wear and tear of machinery,
nor did the operating expenses include even the maintenance
of the convicts while at work. The following fiscal year the
profit estimated in the same way was $39,293.18. During the fiscal
year 1893-'94 the loss on the jute mill was $14,660.22; in 1894-'95
there was a profit of $6,670.56; and in 1895-'96 a loss of $12,288.45.</p>

<p>In five years, therefore, there was nominally a profit of about
$60,000 in this department, but since neither interest, sinking fund,
nor maintenance of the laborers is included among the expenses, the
system can be looked upon only as a means of giving needed exercise
to the prisoners and cheap grain sacks to the farmers. Financially it
is a burden to the taxpayers. The old contract system had its drawbacks,
but it at least afforded a profit, and gave convicts a chance
of learning something about certain trades at which they could perhaps
work when released; the jute mill not only offers no such opportunity,
but is in other ways peculiarly unfit for modern prison
requirements, since all operations in such mills can be stopped or
delayed by the misbehavior of a few operatives. Far better are industries
wherein small groups or individuals are engaged in various
separate minor operations. Besides this, the sacks made by prison
labor will probably have only local uses hereafter, because of a recent
act of Parliament which is held to prevent wheat shipments in such
sacks.</p>

<p>The Folsom Prison owns a magnificent water power and enormous
quarries of granite. Between 1888 and 1894 convict labor amounting
to 683,555 days were expended upon a dam, canal, and powerhouse,
and over 2,000 horse power can already be used. About 250
horse power is now utilized by the prison for electric lights, ice
manufacture, and other purposes. The quarries are being worked to
some extent, and crushed rock for roads is sold at cost or nearly so.
There is a farm that supplies many articles at less cost than if purchased
in the market. At Folsom, as at San Quentin, the authorities
do all in their power to economize, and to utilize convict labor, but the
policy of the State prevents definite progress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the reports of the prison directors and wardens and
the messages of Governors have urged in the strongest terms a change.
The biennial report of 1892-'93 and 1893-'94 says respecting the
great Folsom water power: "If we can use this power solely with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span>
to profitable results to the State, we can return each year a
surplus into the State treasury. We do not think that the State should
refrain from working its convicts or utilizing its advantages because
it may have some effect upon other businesses. All over the United
States prisoners are engaged in manufacturing, and our investigations
lead us to believe that the effect of prison competition, so called, is
greatly overestimated."</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Folsom State Prison.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The biennial report of 1894-'95 and 1895-'96 returns to the subject,
states that the jute mills can not be a success under the restrictions
of the present law, and urges that they should be run on a business
basis, for a profit. It continues, "One source of profit would be
to make use of the granite owned by the State" (at Folsom). It
suggests a consolidation of the two prisons at Folsom, where, with
prison labor and free power, and granite on the ground, a model
prison could be constructed. Warden Aull, of Folsom Prison, in discussing
the subject in 1896, said that for nine years the improvements
there have employed the convicts, but now some new scheme must
be devised. "The convicts must be kept at work. Every consideration
of discipline, economy, reformation, and health demands this."
But he believes that it will not pay the State to make shoes, blankets,
clothing, brooms, tinware, etc. (as has been suggested at various
times) for the eight thousand inmates of our State institutions. There
are over two thousand convicts at Folsom and San Quentin. Only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>
small part of these, he says, could be utilized in making goods for
State institutions, nor would there be any profit unless manufacturing
was on a large scale for the outside markets as well. The experiment
that New York is making will be watched with much interest here.</p>

<p>The California labor unions recently adopted resolutions favoring
"the quarrying of stone by convict labor, and the placing it upon
market undressed at a low figure, in order to give employment to
stone-cutters, stone-masons, and others employed on buildings."
The State rock-crushing plant, if kept running, will utilize the labor
of about two hundred and fifty convicts. Any advance beyond this
point means open war with all the labor unions.</p>

<p>Evidently the time when the prisons of California are to be entirely
self-supporting is still remote, and the public as well as the
union need much more education upon the subject. Some reduction
of expenses, together with any utilization of convict labor that indirectly
benefits a few classes, is all that can be hoped for at present,
but ultimately the reformation of the criminal by making him capable
of self-support as well as anxious to live in peace with society, will
be recognized as the aim of wise penal legislation.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that many profitable industries can be
found, as yet unnaturalized in California, and therefore coming only
incidentally into competition with existing industries, but well
adapted to prison labor. One of these industries is the growth and
preparation of osier willows of many species, and their manufacture
into many useful forms, especially into baskets for fruit pickers and
for wine makers. Another possible industry is the growth and preparation
of various semitropic species of grasses and fiber plants, from
which hat materials, mattings, the baskets used in olive-oil manufacture
and a multitude of other articles can be made. The sale of
crushed rock at Folsom should, of course, be at a price which at least
pays for the sustenance of the convicts employed. The enormous
water power of the prison should ultimately be fully utilized for
manufacturing purposes.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to a consideration more in detail of the separate
prisons, and to a brighter side&mdash;that which concerns the men who
are doing the best they can with a bad system. San Quentin, the
oldest of the two, has been for six years under the wardenship of
an able and attractive man, William E. Hale, formerly Sheriff of
Alameda County. Those who have read the wonderfully interesting
reports of the National Prison Convention are familiar with his
methods and views. The report for 1895 (Denver meeting) shows
that Warden Hale, in the breadth and sanity of his views, easily takes
rank among the best wardens of the country. He thoroughly understands
California and the Californians, and while progressive has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>
never attempted the impossible. In his various reports and addresses
he especially urges more industrial schools, better care of children,
and more kindergartens, such as those established in San Francisco by
the late Sarah B. Cooper. And, indeed, who can read Kate Douglas
Wiggin's story of Patsy without recognizing the value of kindergartens
in the prevention of crime? The San Francisco police once
traced the careers of nine thousand kindergarten pupils, and found
that not one had ever become a law-breaker.</p>

<p>Last summer San Quentin was the scene of an "epidemic of
noise" on the part of many of its inmates. Some of the newspaper
accounts of the affair were painfully exaggerated, and the prison
management in consequence was severely criticised. The fact is that
the outbreak was quelled rapidly and effectually, without outside
help, with only a few days' interruption of work on the jute mill, and
without injury to any person. A hose was simply turned into the
noisy cells until their inmates were subdued.</p>

<p>There have been very few escapes in the history of the prison, and
none in recent years. Its situation, on the extreme eastern end of a
rocky peninsula of Marin County, projecting into the bay of San
Francisco, is extremely well chosen for safety and isolation. The
State owns a large tract here, but it is very poor soil, and much of its
surface clay has been stripped for brick-making, so that no income
from it is possible unless more bricks can be made and sold. The
prison accommodations are extremely cramped, and large quantities
of brick should be used in needed extensions. Many small industries
could be carried on here, if permitted, for water carriage to and
from San Francisco is very cheap. Heavy manufactures requiring
expensive steam power are not justified here.</p>

<p>The abandonment of the large State improvements at San Quentin
seems contrary to the dictates of economy. Equally unwise is the
suggestion that it be made a prison to which only the most dangerous
classes of criminals should be sent. On the other hand, Folsom, with
its quarries and water power, seems fitted for a receiving prison,
where all convicts, without exception, should be placed on indeterminate
sentences at hard labor, and from which, on good behavior,
on the credit system, they might be removed by the prison directors
to San Quentin, there to work at more varied but no less self-supporting
trades. The ponderous jute-mill machinery should all be transferred
to Folsom, where power is now running to waste. At San
Quentin, first, the State should adopt more advanced reformatory
methods.</p>

<p>Official statistics of the two prisons contain many interesting features.
In mere numbers the increase during the past two decades has
not kept pace with the increase in the State's population. San Quentin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>
at present usually contains about fourteen hundred and Folsom
about nine hundred, but an increase equal to the gain in population
would give them three thousand instead of twenty-three hundred.
Even during the so-called hard times of recent years there has been
no marked additions to the criminal classes in California, and the
two great strikes&mdash;that of the ironworkers and that of the railroad
brakemen and firemen&mdash;led to surprisingly few violations of the laws.</p>

<p>Close observers say that there has been a marked increase during
the past decade in the number of tramps, and that petty criminals
have increased everywhere. But there are no statistics of the county
and township jails. It seems certain that many villages and small
towns, even where incorporated, have increasing trouble with gangs
of hoodlums who are rapidly fitting themselves for State prisons.
The reform schools have been largely recruited from this semi-criminal
element, but stronger laws, swifter punishment, more firmness
in dealing with young offenders, and, in brief, a higher grade of
public sentiment on the part of citizens of small towns is evidently
necessary. According to recent discussions in the New York Evening
Post, the same sort of thing occurs in staid New England, and there,
as here, it is one of the most serious problems of the times. From such
a class of idle and vicious boys the prisons will hereafter be recruited,
rather than from newcomers.</p>

<p>The nativity tables of both prisons show that the number of California-born
convicts ranges in recent years from eighteen per cent in
1890 to nearly twenty-five per cent in 1895-'96. In that year in San
Quentin, out of 819 American-born convicts, 314 were born in California,
68 in New York, 44 in Pennsylvania, 41 in Illinois, 36 in
Ohio, and 35 each in Massachusetts and Missouri. Oregon sends 12,
Arizona 10; Washington and Nevada are represented by only one
apiece. The Southern States, excepting Kentucky and Virginia,
send very few. Something the same proportion throughout holds
at Folsom, and fairly indicates the States from which the population
of California is chiefly drawn. The total of American nativity at San
Quentin is sixty-four per cent; at Folsom, as last reported, it was
about sixty-five per cent. Of the foreign born (thirty-six per cent at
San Quentin), 99 out of 481 were Irish, 82 were Chinese, 56 were
German, 49 were Mexican, and 44 were English. No one doubts that
the laws are strictly enforced against the Chinese and the Mexicans
(meaning Spanish-Californians); the other classes have votes and influence,
and often have better chances for avoiding punishment for
misdeeds. Japan contributes only one convict to San Quentin and
two to Folsom. The Chinese as a rule go to prison for assaults upon
each other ("highbinding"), for gambling, or similar offenses, but
seldom for crimes against Americans. The Mexicans generally come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span>
to grief from an old-time <i>penchant</i> for other people's horses, or from
drunken "cutting scrapes."</p>

<p>A racial classification attempted at Folsom showed that out of
905 convicts 704 were Caucasian, 89 Indian and Mexican, 62 Mongolian,
and 50 negroid. I do not find this elsewhere, so it may stand
alone as merely one year's observations.</p>

<p>Of much more importance are the statistics of illiteracy, kept for
a term of years. Warden Hale reports in 1896 that out of 1,287
prisoners, 120 can neither read nor write, 220 can read but can not
write, and 947 can both read and write. Of course, many who are
rated in the third class read and write very poorly, and a careful classification
in terms of the public-school system is essential to clearness.
Warden Aull, at Folsom, reports that out of 905 convicts, 6 are
college men, 81 are from private schools, 53 from both public
and private schools, 582 have attended public schools only, and
147 are illiterate, while the remaining 36 call themselves "self-educated."</p>

<p>According to the evidence of the wardens, no full graduate of any
American university has ever been an inmate of either prison. The
so-called college men were men who had spent some time at a college
of one kind or another. So-called professors appear among the convicts,
but I have been unable to discover that any professor in an institution
of standing has been at either San Quentin or Folsom since
its establishment.</p>

<p>The preceding statistics of illiteracy are defective, but some additional
light can be had from the tables upon occupations. Among
905 prisoners at Folsom, 96 occupations were represented. In round
numbers, thirty-four per cent were mechanics, twenty-nine per cent
were rated as laborers, twenty per cent were in business, and seven
per cent were agriculturists. But a closer analysis of the statistics on
this point shows that nearly fifty-seven per cent of the entire number
came from the following occupations: acrobat, barber, bar-tender,
butler, cook, gardener, hackman, hostler, laborer, laundryman, mill-hand,
miner, nurse, sailor, vaquero, and "no occupation" (22).</p>

<p>The classification of crimes is very complete in all prison statistics,
and usually follows the legal phraseology. Nearly all come
under three great divisions&mdash;crimes against property, crimes of anger,
and crimes which arise from a perverted sexuality. From year to
year the proportion in these great divisions varies but little. In 1894
out of 1,287 convicts, 796 were sentenced for crimes against property,
358 of which were for burglary, 170 for grand larceny, and 39 for
forgery; there were 343 commitments for assaults and murder, 188
of which were for murder in either the first or the second degree;
lastly, there were 85 commitments for rape and other sex crimes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span>
This was a typical year, and will serve to illustrate for all and at
both prisons.</p>

<p>The terms of imprisonment are long: out of 1,300 men in one
annual report, 143 were for life, and 392 for ten years or more. Over
300 prisoners had served more than one term, and some were even
serving their eighth term. Some at Folsom have reached their
twelfth term. The ages of the prisoners have ranged from sixteen to
eighty-six, but the danger period is evidently between eighteen and
forty.</p>

<p>All of the prison officers agree respecting the bad physical condition
of the convicts. Many of them are weak and ill when they
enter the prison; many are the victims of unnamable personal vices.
The physicians at San Quentin in 1895 reported 27 cases of scrofula,
30 of syphilis, 22 of epilepsy, 29 of opium habit, 62 of rheumatism, 70
of typhus fever, and 124 of general debility. Medical statistics at Folsom
show similar conditions, aggravated by the malarial climate of
that locality. The death rate, formerly higher at Folsom than at
San Quentin, is now considerably lower, owing to the much better
accommodations for the prisoners, and the hard outdoor labor required.
In 1896 it was but .79 of one per cent.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to observe that the cost of maintenance of the
prisoners has been gradually reduced. Nearly thirty years ago legislative
committees reported that the cost of running the State's prisons
was four or five times as much in proportion to the inmates as that of
any other State in the Union, and that the prisoners lived better than
the average landowner. More economical methods were gradually
adopted, and by 1891 the cost per diem of a convict was 40 cents.
This has been still further reduced; at San Quentin to 30.45 cents,
and at Folsom to 32.50 cents.</p>

<p>There will always be outside criticisms of the food supplied as
"too good for convicts," but it is merely that of ordinary field laborers,
with much less variety. Under California conditions it could not well
be made cheaper. If the food statistics of the prisons were so compiled
as to separate the butter, olives, raisins, canned fruit, etc.,
properly used on the tables of officers and wardens, from the articles
purchased for the prisoners, much misapprehension would be prevented.</p>

<p>As long as the State pays the entire expense bill, however, there
will be a natural restiveness on the part of the taxpayers; the prison
management, no matter how careful it is, must suffer for the sins of
the system. The present directors and wardens are intelligent and
honest men, who could put the prisons on a self-supporting basis if they
had the authority and the necessary means for the plant required. A
comparatively small amount of manufactures would pay the daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>
maintenance of the prisoners, and thus render the management much
less subject to public criticism.</p>

<p>This article is already as long as seems desirable, and I must close
without describing the California reform schools, which are comparatively
new, but have attracted much attention. At some future time
I may have an opportunity to take up that subject.</p>

<h2>THE SCIENTIFIC EXPERT AND THE BERING SEA CONTROVERSY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By GEORGE A. CLARK.</span></p>


<p>In the November number of the Popular Science Monthly for
1897, Dr. Thomas C. Mendenhall reviews at some length the
workings of the Bering Sea Commission of 1892. Dr. Mendenhall
was himself a member of this commission, and his account of its inside
history is interesting and instructive as throwing light upon the
after-work of the Paris Tribunal of Arbitration for which it was to
prepare the natural-history data.</p>

<p>Dr. Mendenhall naturally finds little to commend in the work
of his colleagues, the British experts, but he does not stop there, and
proceeds to generalize in an uncomplimentary way regarding scientific
experts as a class. For example, he lays down the following just
and admirable rule for scientific investigation: "It should be commenced
with no preconceived notions of how it is to come out, and
judgment should wait upon facts," and then continues to say: "Justice
to the man of science obliges the admission that, take him in his
laboratory or library, with no end in view except that of getting
at the truth, and he generally lives fairly up to this high standard;
but transform him by the magic of a handsome retainer, or any other
incentive, into a scientific expert, and he is a horse of another color."</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this article to argue the cause of the man
of science, or to say whether or not this arraignment is just. It is
the intention merely to bring into contrast with the notable example
of failure which Dr. Mendenhall cites, an equally notable example
of success on the part of the scientific expert. If I mistake not, this
simple comparison will be all the vindication the man of science
needs.</p>

<p>To understand the full force of Dr. Mendenhall's article, it must
be remembered that it appeared on the very eve of the meeting of a
second Bering Sea Commission called to consider the selfsame issues
which occupied the attention of the commission of 1892. The article
therefore stands as a prediction of failure for the new commission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span>
Nor does Dr. Mendenhall leave his meaning obscure in this regard.
He says, "It is difficult to see what good will come from further discussions,
investigations, or declarations"; and his conclusion is, "It
will be impossible to know absolutely which group of scientific experts
(American or British) was right in regard to pelagic sealing," this
last subject being the rock on which the commission of 1892 split.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to go into the details of this first commission.
These are given in Dr. Mendenhall's article. Two things only
are essential to bring this meeting into contrast with the one of 1897.
These are the instructions under which it was organized and its final
report. Both are brief. The first is comprehended in the following
statement, quoted from the Treaty of Arbitration of 1892: "Each
Government shall appoint two commissioners to investigate conjointly
with the commissioners of the other Government all facts having
relation to seal life in Bering Sea, and the necessary measures for its
protection and preservation."</p>

<p>The commissioners duly visited the fur-seal islands in Bering Sea,
made their investigations, and were called together at Washington
to deliberate upon the results obtained, and to prepare a joint report
for the guidance of the Tribunal of Arbitration then about to convene
at Paris. With Dr. Mendenhall was associated, on behalf of
the United States, Dr. C. Hart Merriam. Great Britain was represented
by Sir George Baden-Powell and Dr. George M. Dawson.
The commission began its labors on the 8th of February, and completed
them on the 4th of March following. Its final report, shorn
of verbiage, consists of the following colorless statement: "We find
that since the Alaska purchase a marked diminution in the numbers
of the seals on and habitually resorting to the Pribilof Islands has
taken place; that it is cumulative in effect, and that it is the result of
excessive killing by man." One half of the work set for the commission&mdash;namely,
measures for protection&mdash;was left wholly untouched.</p>

<p>In view of this meager and unsatisfactory result, it is perhaps
not to be wondered at that Dr. Mendenhall should grow skeptical of
the value of expert scientific evidence. But had he sought a cause
of the failure of 1892 he might easily have found one more rational
than the alleged "handsome retainer," or other "incentive."</p>

<p>It is manifestly true that the man of science can legitimately
appear as an "expert" only when his evidence is desired on some
line along which he has done work. An invertebrate morphologist
is not an expert in electricity; nor a physicist in the habits of pinnipeds.
One only of the four gentlemen, called upon in 1892 without
their own consent to act as experts, had even a passing knowledge
of the life history of marine mammals. Dr. Mendenhall was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>
physicist, Dr. Dawson a geologist, and Sir Baden-Powell something
of a sportsman. Dr. Merriam alone, a mammalogist of the first rank,
was a scientific expert in any proper sense.</p>

<p>Moreover, the investigations conducted by the two commissions
were, from a scientific point of view, of the nature of a farce. Less
than two weeks were spent upon the islands, and that at a date
in the season least favorable of all for observations. This meant that
the greater part of their information was got second-hand by the
commissioners.</p>

<p>In marked contrast to the findings of the joint meeting is the
individual report of the American commission, prepared largely by
Dr. Merriam. This stands out as a notable contribution to the subject
of which it treats. Though largely a compilation, so well was
the work of sifting and weighing evidence done, that not a single
statement of fact in it has proved fallacious, and the more exhaustive
investigations of 1896 and 1897 corroborate its conclusions in every
particular. This was the work of the true "scientific expert," and
he can ask no better vindication. The joint commission contained
"experts" of another sort, and its report was necessarily different.</p>

<p>The second Bering Sea Commission came into existence in much
the same way as the first. An agreement was reached in 1896 between
the two nations whereby the entire fur-seal question should
become the subject of a new investigation. This agreement was the
outgrowth of dissatisfaction on the part of the United States with
the workings of the regulations of the Paris award.</p>

<p>The new investigation was begun at once and extended through
the seasons of 1896 and 1897, and again the experts were called together
at Washington to agree, if possible, on a joint statement of
fact. The scope of the investigation and the object of the joint meeting
are succinctly stated in the following words quoted in the preamble
of the commission's report: "To arrive, if possible, at correct
conclusions respecting the numbers, conditions, and habits of the seals
frequenting the Pribilof Islands at the present time as compared with
the several seasons previous and subsequent to the Paris award."</p>

<p>In the commission of 1897 the United States were represented
by Dr. David S. Jordan and Hon. Charles S. Hamlin; Great Britain,
by Prof. D'Arcy W. Thompson and Mr. James M. Macoun. It convened
on the 10th of November and concluded its labors on the 17th,
reaching a full and satisfactory agreement.</p>

<p>It will best serve our purpose to give the final report of the commission
of 1897 in full. Two reasons make this appropriate: First,
the substance of the sixteen concisely worded propositions of which
it is made up can scarcely be stated in fewer words than the original.
In fact, instead of condensing them, it will be necessary to amplify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span>
and explain many of the points made in order to be sure that they are
clear to the lay reader. Second, the report has for some reason received
practically no notice in the American press, and it is to be
feared that the importance of the document has not been fully appreciated
by the American public.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. There is adequate evidence that since the year 1884, and down to the
date of the inspection of the rookeries in 1897, the fur-seal herd of the Pribilof
Islands, as measured on either the hauling grounds or breeding grounds,
has declined in numbers at a rate varying from year to year.</p></blockquote>

<p>This proposition is in effect a restatement of the first clause of
the agreement of 1892, but it is much more definitely put. The decline
is not made to date vaguely "since the Alaska purchase"
(1867), but "since the year 1884." This latter date is significant for
a number of things. Prior to it for a period of thirteen years there
had been no difficulty in securing the normal quota of 100,000 skins
annually. In other words, up to that time the herd had remained in
a state of equilibrium, yielding a maximum product. Again, this
date marks the advent of pelagic sealing in Bering Sea, and the beginning
of that remarkable expansion of the industry which culminated
ten years later in 1894. The decline of the herd is thus
made synonymous with the rise of pelagic sealing.</p>

<p>The real significance of this proposition, however, lies in the fact
that the decline is declared to have been continuous to the present
time. In other words, it did not stop or even slacken with the season
of 1894. In this season, it will be remembered, the regulations of
the Paris award, avowedly for the "protection and preservation of
the fur-seal herd," went into effect. Translated into direct statement,
this proposition is an admission that the regulations have failed
of their object.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>2. In the absence for the earlier years of actual counts of the rookeries
such as have been made in recent years, the best approximate measure of
decline available is found in these facts:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> About 100,000 male seals of recognized killable age were obtained
from the hauling grounds each year from 1871 to 1889. The table of statistics
given in Appendix I<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> shows, on the whole, a progressive increase in
the number of hauling grounds driven and in the number of drives made,
as well as a retardation of the date at which the quota was attained during
a number of years prior to 1889.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> In the year 1896, 28,964 killable seals were taken after continuing the
driving till July 27th, and in 1897 19,189 after continuing the driving till
August 11th. We have no reason to believe that during the period 1896
and 1897 a very much larger number of males of recognized killable age
could have been taken on the hauling grounds.</p>

<p>The reduction between the years 1896 and 1897 in the number of killable
seals taken, while an indication of decrease in the breeding herd, can not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>
taken as an actual measure of such decrease. A number of other factors must
be taken into consideration, and the real measure of decrease must be sought
in more pertinent statistics, drawn from the breeding rookeries themselves.</p></blockquote>


<p>We have already noted that in that portion of the period, 1871
to 1889, which falls prior to 1884, thirteen years in all, no difficulty
was experienced in securing the full quota, and it may be added that
this was completed not later than July 20th. A retardation of the
date at which the quota can be filled is a direct indication of the degree
of exhaustion of the hauling grounds. In marked contrast with
these earlier years stand the conditions of 1896 and 1897, when
greatly reduced quotas only were obtained, notwithstanding the unusual
prolongation of the driving period.</p>

<p>The statement here made that the difference between the quotas
of 1896 and 1897 is not an actual measure of decline in the breeding
herd requires explanation. The quota of any year is dependent upon
the birth rate of three years previous, killable seals being males of
approximately three years of age. The difference noted, therefore,
while not indicative of the actual decrease for the seasons 1896 and
1897, is a direct measure of such decrease for the seasons of 1893 and
1894, when the seals in question were born.</p>

<p>That the rate of decline as thus shown was greater in 1893-'94
than in 1896-'97 is explained by the fact that, whereas only 30,000
seals were taken at sea in 1893, 60,000 were taken in 1894; while
in 1896 43,000 were taken as against only 25,000 in 1897. In other
words, the pelagic catch of 1894 exceeded that of 1893 by one hundred
per cent, while that of 1897 fell seventy-two per cent below that
of 1896. It is not, therefore, strange that the quota of 1897 should
show a reduction of thirty per cent as against one of twelve per cent
in the breeding herd for the same year.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>3. From these data it is plain that the former yield of the hauling grounds
of the Pribilof Islands was from three to five times as great as in the years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>
1896 and 1897, and the same diminution to one third or one fifth of the
former product may be assumed when we include also the results of the
hunting at sea.</p></blockquote>

<p>This proposition needs little comment. It is a simple deduction
from the conditions of the preceding paragraph. The minimum
estimate of former conditions is the lowest possible figure that could
be in any way defended. The larger figure is apparently more nearly
correct. The quota of 1898, of which we now have the record also,
was about 18,000. It is not so stated in this paragraph, but the
inference is inevitable that what is thus given as the decline of the
"yield of the hauling grounds" is equally the decline of the breeding
herd. A breeding herd which yielded without difficulty annually
100,000 killable animals (superfluous males of three years of
age) must be reduced to something like one fifth its former size when
it is able only with extreme difficulty to yield a quota of 20,000 such
animals.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>4. The death rate among young fur seals, especially among the pups, is
very great. While the loss among the pups prior to their departure from
the islands has been found in the past two years to approach twenty per
cent of the whole number born, and though the rate of subsequent mortality
is unknown, we may gather from the number which return each
year that from one half to two thirds have perished before the age of three
years&mdash;that is to say, the killable age for the males and the breeding age
for the females.</p></blockquote>

<p>The maximum and minimum figures here represent a division
of opinion. The larger figure of two thirds would even seem to be
a conservative estimate. The birth rate of 1897, as we know from
close estimate, was approximately 130,000; it must have been greater
in 1894, approaching 200,000. From this larger birth rate only
about 20,000 males survived (the quota of 1897). There was doubtless
a like number of females, the sexes being equal at birth and
subject to like causes of natural loss. This gives a total of 40,000
in all, out of a birth rate of 200,000, which survived to the age of
three years. This is one fifth, and it is evident that the mortality
exceeds rather than falls below the maximum of two thirds.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>5. The chief natural causes of death among pups, so far as known at
present, are as follows, the importance of each being variable and more or
less uncertain:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Ravages of the parasitic worm <i>Uncinaria</i>; most destructive on sandy
breeding areas and during the period from July 15th to August 20th.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Trampling by fighting bulls or by moving bulls and cows, a source
of loss greatest among young pups.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Starvation of pups strayed or separated from their mothers when
very young, or whose mothers have died from natural causes.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Ravages of the great killer (<i>Orca</i>), known to be fatal to many of the
young, and perhaps also to older seals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span></p>

<p>At a later period drowning in the storms of winter is believed, but not
certainly known, to be a cause of death among the older pups.</p></blockquote>

<p>The causes of death here enumerated are natural and inherent
in the conditions under which the herd exists. That some of them
were not known or fully understood until the investigations of 1896
and 1897 does not make them new or recent in their action. They
have been constant factors, acting with greater intensity in the past
when the herd was larger and more crowded upon its breeding
grounds. Photographs taken in 1891 and 1892 show that the parasitic
worm was then doing its deadly work, and more extensively in
proportion as the herd was larger. For 1,495 pups dead from this
cause counted by us on Tolstoi sand flat in 1896, 4,000 were counted
on the same ground by the British commissioner of 1892. Moreover,
the bones of innumerable pups on ground already abandoned
in that year by the declining herd attest the existence of this cause
of death prior to that time. We have no reason to suppose that it
has not always preyed upon the herd. Death by trampling must at
present be at a minimum on account of the scattered condition of
the rookeries. The storms of winter and pelagic enemies must, of
course, take toll in proportion to the number of animals.</p>

<p>But the significant fact shown by this proposition is that the gain
of the herd must be small at best under such a natural death rate.
We may suppose these natural losses to have been the checks which
in a state of nature prevented the indefinite increase of the herd.
When, therefore, to this total loss of from two thirds to four fifths
of the entire birth rate before breeding age is attained, we add the
tremendous artificial loss through the destruction of gravid and nursing
females resulting from pelagic sealing, it is not to be wondered at
that the equilibrium was broken and the herd sent on a rapid decline.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>6. Counts of certain rookeries, with partial counts and estimates of
others, show that the number of breeding females bearing pups on St.
Paul and St. George Island was, in 1896 and 1897, between 160,000 and
130,000, more nearly approaching the higher figure in 1896 and the lower
in 1897.</p></blockquote>

<p>These figures are based upon counts of all the breeding families
on both islands for each season. On certain rookeries the live and
dead pups were counted. In this way an average size of family was
obtained which was used to complete the census where pups could
not be counted.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>7. On certain rookeries where pups were counted in both seasons, 16,241
being found in 1896 and 14,318 in 1897, or, applying a count adopted by Professor
Thompson, 14,743 in the latter year, there is evident a decrease of
nine to twelve per cent within the twelvemonth in question. The count
of pups is the most trustworthy measure of numerical variation in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span>
herd. The counts of harems, and especially of cows present, are much inferior
in value. The latter counts, however, point in the same direction.
The harems on all the rookeries were counted in both seasons. In 1896
there were 4,932; in 1897 there were 4,418, a decrease of 10.41 per cent.
The cows actually present on certain rookeries at the height of the season
were counted in both seasons. Where 10,198 were found in 1896, 7,307
were found in 1897, a decrease of 28.34 per cent.</p></blockquote>

<p>The important element in these special counts, undertaken with
a view to determining the relative condition of the breeding herd for
the two seasons, is the count of pups. All other classes of rookery
population fluctuate from day to day, but the pups remain constantly
on shore and near to the place of birth for the first six weeks of their
lives, and it is merely a matter of patience and skill in counting them.
Such a count on any rookery is an absolute record of the number
of breeding females which has visited it for the season in question.</p>

<p>The minimum figure of nine per cent adopted by Professor
Thompson is based upon a recount of a single rookery made by himself
under conditions less favorable for accuracy than in the case of
the official counts, which give the larger figure of twelve per cent,
and which were made jointly by representatives of both commissions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>8. It is not easy to apply the various counts in the form of a general
average to all the rookeries of the islands. We recognize that a notable
decrease has been suffered by the herd during the twelvemonth 1896 to
1897, without attempting, save by setting the above numbers on record, to
ascribe to the decrease more precise figures.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a rather extreme statement of the uncertainty which may
be assumed to attach to these figures. The problem is not an easy
one at best and its factors are complex. This should always be borne
in mind, but not to the extent of doubting the value of the figures.
The areas counted were large enough to be fairly typical. The counts
were carefully done, and are accurate enough for all practical purposes.
The probable error for the 15,000 more or less pups counted
would not exceed 500. But as the counting was done in exactly the
same manner and by the same persons for the two seasons, such errors
as may exist are common to both counts and the relative conditions
are unaltered. The figure of twelve per cent, moreover, must be
taken as in itself a minimum, since it is the result of a number of
individual counts varying in accuracy; and all in a sense underestimates,
inasmuch as more animals are always overlooked among the
rocks than are counted twice.</p>

<p>But the exact percentage of decrease is immaterial. That it has
been a "notable" decrease is sufficient, and this is unquestioned. It
may be noted in passing that this unequivocal decrease occurs in two
seasons during which there was perfect enforcement of the regulations
of the Paris award.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>9. The methods of driving and killing practiced on the islands, as they
have come under our observation during the past two seasons, call for no
criticism or objection. An adequate supply of bulls is present on the rookeries;
the number of older bachelors rejected in the drives during the period
in question is such as to safeguard in the immediate future a similarly
adequate supply; the breeding bulls, females, and pups on the breeding
grounds are not disturbed; there is no evidence or sign of impairment of
virility of males; the operations of driving and killing are conducted skillfully
and without inhumanity.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was agreed by the commission of 1892 that "excessive killing
by man" was the cause of the decline of the herd. As to the
"man" in question the two sets of commissioners differed diametrically.
The Americans placed the responsibility with the pelagic
sealer; the British, with the lessees through their methods of sealing
on land.</p>

<p>To any one who is at all familiar with the conspicuous part which
the theories of close killing, and especially overdriving, played in the
British contention before the Paris Tribunal of Arbitration, this full
and frank vindication comes as a refreshing surprise. That it should
be agreed to by British scientific experts ought to revive even Dr.
Mendenhall's faith. It is true that the statement is carefully limited
to the seasons under observation, but neither the principle nor the
methods of land killing have been altered within the past half century
except in so far as they have been improved. It was an absurd
and foolish theory which ascribed to the treatment of the non-breeding
and superfluous male life of a herd of polygamous animals responsibility
for the decline of its breeding stock, but it served a purpose
useful to Canadian interests before the Paris tribunal. It is
now forever eliminated from the fur-seal question.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>10. The pelagic industry is conducted in an orderly manner, and in a
spirit of acquiescence in the limitations imposed by law.</p></blockquote>

<p>This statement is true, though wholly irrelevant to the question
of the efficiency of the regulations themselves. Moreover, it stands
as an implied impeachment of the active and efficient patrol fleet
constantly maintained by the United States and Great Britain for
the enforcement of the regulations governing the pelagic industry.
For example, there were in 1896 five American and three British
vessels engaged in active patrol of the waters of Bering Sea. One
would think it a foregone conclusion that the pelagic industry should
be law-abiding, whether of its own volition or not. In addition to
all this, however, the regulations are as admirably suited to the
needs of the pelagic sealer as if he had himself prepared them. There
is, therefore, no reasonable incentive to violate them. Viewed in this
light, this statement seems ludicrous, but it has a justification not
evident at first sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span></p>

<p>The British experts demanded this statement as a balm for the
wounded feelings of the pelagic sealer, and, such being the fact, the
American commissioners assumed that it could do no harm to place
it on record that he has conformed to the requirements of the law.
But from the American point of view this paragraph has a wider and
deeper meaning. We have seen in the opening paragraph that the
decline in the herd has been continuous and uninterrupted during
the period of the Paris regulations. It is admitted in paragraph 8
that the decrease for this same period has been a "notable" one.
The rate is specified in paragraph 7 as from "nine to twelve per
cent" during two years when the regulations were rigidly enforced.
It only requires the climax of paragraph 10, asserting
the perfect observance of the regulations, to complete their condemnation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>11. Pelagic sealing involves the killing of males and females alike,
without discrimination and in proportion as the two sexes coexist in the
sea. The reduction of the males effected on the islands causes an enhanced
proportion of females to be found in the pelagic catch; hence this proportion,
if it vary from no other cause, varies at least with the catch on the
islands. In 1895 Mr. A. B. Alexander, on behalf of the Government of
the United States, found 62.3 per cent of females in the catch of the Dora
Sieward in Bering Sea; and in 1896 Mr. Andrew Halkett, on behalf of the
Canadian Government, found 84.2 per cent in the catch of the same
schooner in the same sea. There are no doubt instances, especially in the
season of migration and in the course of the migrating herds, of catches
containing a different proportion of the two sexes.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are two ways and two alone whereby killing by man affects
the fur-seal herd&mdash;namely, killing on land and killing at sea. Land
killing has been vindicated in paragraph 9. We have here the necessary
condemnation of pelagic killing expressed in equally full and
frank terms. Land killing takes only males and leaves an adequate
supply of bulls for breeding purposes; pelagic killing takes males and
females alike, the latter sex constituting 62 to 84 out of every 100
killed.</p>

<p>It is not a vital matter that the female sex should be found to
predominate in the pelagic catch, except in so far as it proves the
falsity of the returns made so persistently by the Canadian sealing
captain that the sexes are taken in virtually equal proportion at
sea. The essential thing is that females are killed at all. That
three fourths of all the animals taken at sea (during one season
140,000 animals were so taken) are of this sex only emphasizes the
destructive nature of this industry.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>12. The large proportion of females in the pelagic catch includes not
only adult females that are both nursing and pregnant, but also young
seals that are not pregnant and others that have not yet brought forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>
young, with such also as have recently lost their young through the various
causes of natural mortality.</p></blockquote>

<p>This statement is put in the mildest possible form out of consideration
for the old-time British contentions that the breeding
females did not leave the islands while their young were dependent
upon them, and that those taken at sea were "barren." The investigations
of 1896 and 1897 proved conclusively that every female
of two years old and over taken at sea was pregnant, and that those
over two years of age when taken in Bering Sea were in addition
nursing, having dependent pups on the islands. The manner of
statement seems to imply an equality in importance between
"young" seals and "adults." As females are never killed on land,
they are naturally of all ages when found at sea, and the young
animals (yearlings and two-year-olds) are necessarily vastly in the
minority.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>13. The polygamous habit of the animal, coupled with an equal birth
rate of the two sexes, permits a large number of males to be removed with
impunity from the herd, while, as with other animals, any similar abstraction
of females checks or lessens the herd's increase, or, when carried
further, brings about an actual diminution of the herd. It is equally plain
that a certain number of females may be killed without involving the
actual diminution of the herd, if the number killed does not exceed the annual
increment of the breeding herd, taking into consideration the annual
losses by death through old age and through incidents of the sea.</p></blockquote>

<p>This paragraph is really supplementary to 9 and 11. Neither
the methods nor yet the principle of land killing are at fault. The
animal being polygamous, a part of its male life can be removed with
impunity. On the other hand, the killing of females leads to disastrous
results.</p>

<p>The concluding sentence is a concession to diplomacy. It is
true that a certain number of females may be killed without producing
actual diminution. If pelagic sealing were stopped to-day the
herd would naturally begin to increase. The measure of its increase
would be the difference between the natural loss of adult breeders
through old age and incidents of the sea, on the one hand, and the
yearly accession of young breeders to bear their first pups, on the
other. We can closely estimate the latter factor. It was equal, for
example, to the quota of 20,000 in 1897, or sixteen and two thirds
per cent of the birth rate. The quota was composed of males of approximately
three years, and we may assume that a like number of
three-year-old females entered the rookeries for the first time in the
same season. We have then a gross gain to the breeding herd of
sixteen and two thirds per cent.</p>

<p>We have no means of exact estimate for the loss of adult females<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span>
because we do not know the period of life in the female. If, however,
we estimate it at thirteen years, which seems to be a conservative
figure, the animal would have ten years of breeding life. Then, from
old age alone, ten per cent of the adult breeding females must die
annually. This leaves a net gain of six and two thirds per cent with
accidental factors unaccounted for. The killing of females which
does not produce actual diminution must come well within this margin
of six and two thirds per cent. It only remains to be stated that
the pelagic catch of 1897, which was the smallest on record since
1884, exceeded fourteen per cent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>14. While, whether from a consideration of the birth rate or from an
inspection of the visible effects, it is manifest that the take of females in
recent years has been so far in excess of the natural increment as to lead
to the reduction of the herd in the degree related above, yet the ratio of
the pelagic catch of one year to that of the following has fallen off more
rapidly than the ratio of the breeding herd of one year to the breeding
herd of the next.</p></blockquote>

<p>This paragraph corrects possible erroneous implications which
might be drawn from the truism in the preceding paragraph. A
certain number of females may be taken, etc., but so many in excess
of the safety limit have been taken that the herd has been reduced
"in the degree related above"&mdash;that is, for 1896-'97, nine to twelve
per cent, and for 1884-'97, fifty to eighty per cent.</p>

<p>Dr. Mendenhall said: "It will be impossible to know absolutely
which group of scientific experts was right (in 1892) in regard to
pelagic sealing." The admission made in this paragraph, taken together
with other admissions made in paragraphs 11 and 12, effectually
disproves this prediction. It ought to be a source of gratification
to Dr. Mendenhall and to his colleague, Dr. Merriam, to find it thus
clearly proved that they were right and their British associates wrong.</p>

<p>The final clause is here again a diplomatic concession to take the
sting out of the real admission. The rapid fall in the pelagic catch
as compared with the more even decline of the breeding herd is a
natural phenomenon. Pelagic sealing not only destroys the herd,
but it is necessarily self-destructive because it preys upon its own
capital. The more successful it is the sooner it must cease. With
the decline of the herd it is itself declining, and the rapidity of its
fall proves the nearness of the end. For the years since 1894 the
pelagic catch has been 61,000, 56,000, 43,000, and 25,000 respectively.
It is a significant fact that in four years, under regulations
which permit the pelagic sealer to take all he can get, the product
of his industry has fallen to less than one half.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>15. In this greater reduction of the pelagic catch, compared with the
gradual decrease of the herd, there is a tendency toward equilibrium, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span>
a stage at which the numbers of the breeding herd would neither increase
nor decrease. In considering the probable size of the herd in the immediate
future, there remains to be estimated the additional factor of decline
resulting from reductions in the number of surviving pups, caused by the
larger pelagic catch of 1894 and 1895.</p></blockquote>

<p>The two statements in this paragraph are not related. The first
is a part of the preceding paragraph and is self-evident. Should the
pelagic catch continue to decrease, as it must, it will eventually come
within the margin of six and two thirds per cent. It has yet to fall
far before this end is reached. Then will come that much-mooted
"equilibrium," when the herd will be too insignificant to be worthy
of attack&mdash;the equilibrium of ruin. There is no comfort in this
prospect, either for the pelagic sealer or for the owner of the herd,
and it takes no note of the injury which has been accomplished in
the past, much less of possible restoration in the future. The equilibrium
here suggested is purely a figure of speech, another concession
to diplomacy.</p>

<p>The final statement of this paragraph is more important. The
starvation of pups as a result of the killing of mothers at sea has
been a fact strenuously denied from the first by the British side of
the fur-seal controversy. After the actual counting of 16,000 of
these starved pups in 1896, this position could no longer be maintained.
At the same time a specific admission of the fact of starvation
and of the destruction of unborn pups was too difficult a matter
for the British experts to face. These facts are left to be inferred
from the "reductions in surviving pups" here noted and from the
admission that "nursing and pregnant females" are taken in the
pelagic catch. Stated directly, it is here admitted that on account
of "the larger pelagic catch of 1894 and 1895," numbers of pups
starved to death on the rookeries or died unborn with their mothers
which in the course of Nature should have reached the killable and
breeding age.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>16. The diminution of the herd is yet far from a stage which involves
or threatens the actual extermination of the species, so long as it is protected
in its haunts on land. It is not possible during the continuation of
the conservative methods at present in force upon the islands, with the
further safeguard of the protected zone at sea, that any pelagic killing
should accomplish this final end. There is evidence, however, that in its
present condition the herd yields an inconsiderable return either to the
lessees of the islands or to the owners of the pelagic fleet.</p></blockquote>

<p>The statements of this concluding paragraph must be taken in
close connection, and the "ifs" must be carefully noted if they are
not to prove very misleading. The opening sentence refers to the
biologic extinction of the herd as contrasted with its commercial ruin.
The former is as yet far off, the latter is a matter of history, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span>
is admitted in the concluding statement&mdash;"an inconsiderable return."
This means simply that the herd has ceased to be a commercial
factor, and henceforth under present conditions sealing,
whether on land or at sea, must be conducted at a loss.</p>

<p>This has an important bearing upon the suggested impossibility
of bringing about the extinction of the species. It all depends upon
whether present conditions are maintained. The breeding islands
and the sixty-mile protected zone must be guarded. It cost the
United States $175,000 for patrol in 1896. England's expense was
less, but still considerable. It is beyond reason that this expensive
protection should be continued at a loss or without hope of ultimate
restoration of the herd. Remove the protection for a single season
and the herd would be practically exterminated. A scattered remnant
would doubtless escape to maintain a melancholy equilibrium,
or perhaps to recuperate and again attract the cupidity of some adventurous
sealing captain, but the herd as such would be at an end.</p>

<p>Stated without reference to diplomatic necessities, this concluding
paragraph admits two important things: first, that the herd of
fur seals resorting to the Pribilof Islands is commercially ruined;
second, that its extinction as a species only awaits the abandonment
of certain arduous and costly measures of protection now maintained
solely in the hope of more adequate protection and the ultimate
restoration of the herd.</p>

<p>Such was the work of the Conference of Fur-Seal Experts of
1897. The handwriting of diplomacy is mingled with that of science
in its findings, but the resulting obscurity affects only minor matters.
The important issues of the vexatious Bering Sea controversy are
squarely met and finally settled. It is needless to say that there no
longer exists a fur-seal question. It is merely a question of how to
get rid of the destructive agency of pelagic sealing. This is a matter
for diplomacy to adjust. Any odium which may have attached to
the "man of science" as a result of the failure of the meeting of
1892 is effectually wiped out, and if the lesson is read aright by
the nations, henceforth the scientific expert must be counted an
essential factor in the settlement of governmental disputes.</p>

<h2>A SCHOOL FOR THE STUDY OF LIFE UNDER THE SEA.</h2>

<p class="center"><big>(<i>Naples Aquarium.</i>)</big></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By ELEANOR HODGEN PATTERSON.</span></p>


<p>To go deep down under the sea, in the warm waters of the south,
where exist not only the varieties of fish with which we are
familiar, but thousands of jewel-like forms of animal life never seen
by us, has hitherto been impossible to any but the boldest fishermen
and divers. But of late years in the small aquarium at Naples the sea
has been brought up, so to speak, upon the earth for us to see these
strange creatures as they exist in their homes under the water, as they
eat their food, as they love and hate, and prey upon each other.</p>

<p>Small as the collection at first seems to be, there is no zo&ouml;logical
station in the world to compare with it. Probably there never will
be again. Because of its advantageous station on the shores of the
Mediterranean, where it is claimed the waters which wash Italy
and Sicily yield a greater variety of sea life than even tropical
waters, and also its comparative accessibility to all countries, the
scholars who come here from all over the world find that they are
able to study here as they can nowhere else the strange habits of the
tiny animals down at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>There is no superfluous room taken up in the Naples aquarium
for the fish that may be studied in aquariums elsewhere. Only the
rarest, the strangest, the most curious creatures are here to be seen.</p>

<p>But one room of the beautiful building devoted to the zo&ouml;logical
station, which stands on that street of Naples running along the sea,
is shown to the public. One walks into it from the level of the
street, and the transition from the light outside to strange semi-darkness
is as if one were to suddenly find himself walking upon the
bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>The light comes only from above, shining through water of many
hundreds of cubic feet, on to what seems at first a garden of moving
flowers behind tanks of clear glass, which seem, so complete is the
illusion, not like glass at all, but water. The visitor walks along
dark alleys lined on both sides with these brilliant tanks, and the
beautiful sea animals are so close that it seems easy to touch them. It
is like being in a narrow, dark theater with the stage all around and
about, strangely illuminated, not by footlights, but by a radiance
from above.</p>

<p>There are about thirty tanks in all, and at the very first of these
glass-walled vats we stopped entranced. Behind it were piles of
rocks shining in the water, and from every crevice grew what seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>
brilliant flowers, but of colors so soft and waxlike that they were
almost more lovely than our flowers of earth.</p>

<p>"Surely these deep red ones that cover the rocks to the left are
a species of aster, and these are cacti, and these, yes, these reddish-brown
one are chrysanthemums and nothing else."</p>

<p>But even as we spoke we saw the petals of first one, then another,
flower wave back and forth, and in and out, with curious curling
movements, as none of our flowers do, even in the most various
winds, and then from above a long pole was suddenly thrust down
into the water, at the end of which was stuck a piece of raw red
meat about as large as a walnut.</p>

<p>It was the keeper come to feed his strange charges. Again and
again were the bits of meat thrust down into the hearts of the sea
flowers, and then we discovered with a kind of shock that these
asters and cacti and chrysanthemums were not flowers at all, but
flesh-eating animals, and that each waving petal was a mouth, by
which the creature sucked in the blood of the meat.</p>

<p>When all the juice had been extracted from the meat, the many
mouths attached to each seeming flower, that had been tightly curled
upon the raw flesh, now unfolded again into their petal-like positions
in a circle, one over the other, and the meat, now but a tiny ball
of dry pulp, slowly sank to the bottom of the tank. What the
calyx was like, or whether it had any body at all, we could not see,
so entirely hidden was it behind these many waving, armlike mouths.</p>

<p>In the next tank several sea horses were swimming merrily in
and out of rocks that were covered by a growth of miniature trees.
They were smaller than the tiniest hobbyhorse that has ever been
seen, as small almost as the toy horses in a "Noah's ark." The resemblance
of these small fish, not larger than smelts or minnows, that
have come to be known as "sea horses," to real horses is in the head
only. The rest of the body tapers off into the ordinary fishlike form.
I wondered, as I looked at these small horses of the sea, if it was from
them that the old myth of the existence of mermaids arose. "Half
fish, half women" were the mermaids, but "half fish, half horses"
are these fish.</p>

<p>They were lively little creatures, and swam in and out of the
tiny forest as if they were playing a game of "tag." What a
beautiful little forest it was to play in! The trees had brown trunks
about the size of one's finger, and from the top a graceful, palmlike
foliage branched out, but the foliage was not in greens, but deep,
translucent reds, or coral pinks, or warm browns.</p>

<p>While I was admiring one of the little coral pink trees, one of
the sea horses swam straight into its foliage, when, to my amazement,
and evidently to the amazement of the sea horse also, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span>
foliage instantly disappeared down into the tree trunk, leaving only
the brown stem standing.</p>

<p>Aghast with surprise at the sudden revelation that this charming
foliage, like the petals of the flowers in the last tank, was also
a cluster of living suckers, I asked what name they were called
by, and heard with disgust the answer "worms." These beautiful,
curious creatures only the things we know by the loathsome word
"worms!"</p>

<p>These sea worms, or annelids, as the scientific scholars call them,
build up for themselves the brown tubes that resemble the rough
stems of pines or palms, and from the top they send out their worm-like
bodies in clusters, where they wave back and forth in the water,
to sweep in any food that may be near, always holding themselves in
readiness to withdraw into their holes at danger.</p>

<p>Whether the brilliant foliage of each tree was but the many tentacles
of a single animal emerging from the tube, or whether it was
a whole family of worms come up to the top of their home to gaze
from the chimney, so to speak, we could not discover. But, strange
to say, the grotesque little sea horse seemed to be trying to decide
that question for himself, for, after swimming away a moment in
fright at this sudden disappearance, he returned and appeared to be
peeping down into the tube.</p>

<p>The next tank revealed even greater surprise than we had yet
seen. Here in the water long white gauze ribbons were waving, as
if hung from above, and so transparent that we could see quite
through them, almost as if they were composed of the white of an
egg. It was only by looking closely that up near the top we could
see a tiny black dot, like a pinhead, in each fleecy scarf. This was
the head of the animal, or its eye, or mouth, or whatever such a
delicate dot might be called.</p>

<p>These are of the jellyfish family, and have only lately been
added to the aquarium. Owing to the difficulty of procuring such
pulplike masses, they are extremely rare specimens, and can be seen
nowhere else. Surely nothing more frail, more delicately lovely
exists on land or sea, in plant or animal life, than these gauzy living
sashes of the sea.</p>

<p>But not all the denizens of the tanks are beautiful to look upon.
There is a tank near the door of entrance filled with objects so hideous
that one starts away from them with horror. These are the
octopi, or devilfish. Imagine the ugliest, biggest black spider that
you ever saw, and enlarge it to the size of the largest turtle you ever
saw, and on the end of each of the spider's legs fasten a wicked-looking
mouth, and you can form some idea of how frightful an
octopus can be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span></p>

<p>Several of these monsters were writhing near the glass wall,
stretching out their long, boneless arms, and sometimes fastening
their suckers upon the glass in the search for food, thus unconsciously
showing off the ugliness of their mouths. It was now time for the
keeper to come to them in his round of feeding. He put into the
tank from above a number of crabs, when suddenly the whole tank
seemed filled with octopi. They had been sleeping among the dark
rocks, of which they were so much the color that we had not before
observed them. The poor little crabs had probably been stunned,
or perhaps killed, by the keeper, for they made no resistance when
the octopi fastened upon them their long suckers in a death-grasp.
The octopi fought with each other over the possession of the crabs,
and for some moments there was a terrible waving to and fro of black
suckers fully two yards in length.</p>

<p>Beside this tank was another of clear water in which were some
peaceful cuttlefish. The keeper, for a few coins, stirred these out
of their quiet by moving his long stick after them. They swam
about in fright for a moment or two, and then we saw them no more,
for the clear water had suddenly become a thick black fluid. The
cuttlefish had discharged their bags of ink to escape the pursuing
enemy.</p>

<p>The upper floors of the zo&ouml;logical station are seldom shown to
visitors, but these are almost more interesting than the tank room
below. Here the great scholars who make a life study of these
strange inhabitants of the deep have their tables; here the dredgings
of the sea are brought by fishermen and divers for them to assort;
here sea animals are developed by them from the egg, and even
from invisible germs.</p>

<p>Each investigator into the strange lower world is furnished with
his own aquaria, suited to the special branch he may be studying, for
nearly all are interested in a special branch of zo&ouml;logy. One man
has come a long distance to pursue the study of sponges, and he is
furnished with a perfect garden of them, for they are brought up
from this part of the Mediterranean in infinite variety.</p>

<p>Another student is studying the habits of mollusks, and basins
and jars of these and their eggs are near him. There are divers'
costumes hanging on the walls in which the <i>savants</i> may themselves
descend to the bottom of the sea and study the inhabitants in their
native houses.</p>

<p>There are laboratories and libraries here, adapted to the most
exhaustive study, and a fleet of small boats is also kept exclusively
for the use of the zo&ouml;logical station.</p>

<p>Fishermen constantly bring in baskets filled with what seems to
be only wet rubbish, heaps of stones, and worthless bits of pulp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>
This is examined and assorted by trained eyes, and placed in tanks
of water where siphons are constantly pouring fresh sea water, after
which the rubbish is quietly left until accustomed to its new quarters.
Then cautiously this rubbish begins to move, the stones stir,
and the pulp opens into the beautiful colors, the plants, the gauzy
scarfs, and the numerous other strange things afterward shown to
the public in the aquarium below.</p>

<p>Along the walls of these upper rooms are jars wherein are preserved
many curious denizens of the sea that have been killed by
powerful chemicals, which have surprised the delicate animals before
their sensitive tentacles have had time to close, thus preserving to
science many rare creatures impossible to keep long in captivity.</p>

<p>The great cost of this establishment is maintained in several
ways&mdash;by the issuing of publications and scientific papers in several
languages, by the rents from the desks or tables used by the investigators,
and by the unusually large price of admission demanded
from the public at the aquarium entrance. In addition to this are
the fees from the students who come from afar to study here. A
payment of four hundred dollars each gives students the right to
study in the Naples zo&ouml;logical station for ten months of the year.</p>

<h2>SCIENCE IN EDUCATION.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Sir ARCHIBALD GEIKIE, D. C. L., F. R. S.</span></p>


<p>When the history of education during the nineteenth century
comes to be written, one of its most striking features will
be presented by the rise and growth of science in the general educational
arrangements of every civilized country. At the beginning
of the century our schools and colleges were still following, with comparatively
little change, the methods and subjects of tuition that
had been in use from the time of the middle ages. But the extraordinary
development of the physical and natural sciences, which has
done so much to alter the ordinary conditions of life, has powerfully
affected also our system of public instruction. The medi&aelig;val circle
of studies has been widely recognized not to supply all the mental
training needed in the ampler range of modern requirement. Science
has, step by step, gained a footing in the strongholds of the older
learning. Not without vehement struggle, however, has she been
able to intrench herself there. Even now, although her ultimate
victory is assured, the warfare is by no means at an end. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span>
jealousy of the older <i>r&eacute;gime</i> and the strenuous, if sometimes blatant,
belligerency of the reformers have not yet been pacified; and, from
time to time, within our public schools and universities, there may
still be heard the growls of opposition and the shouts of conflict. But
these sounds are growing fainter. Even the most conservative don
hardly ventures nowadays openly to denounce Science and all her
works. Grudgingly, it may be, but yet perforce, he has to admit the
teaching of modern science to a place among the subjects which the
university embraces, and in which it grants degrees. In our public
schools a "modern side" has been introduced, and even on the classical
side an increasing share of the curriculum is devoted to oral and
practical teaching in science. New colleges have been founded in the
more important centers of population, for the purpose, more particularly,
of enabling the community to obtain a thorough education in
modern science.</p>

<p>The mainspring of this remarkable educational revolution has,
doubtless, been the earnest conviction that the older learning was no
longer adequate in the changed and changing conditions of our time;
that vast new fields of knowledge, opened up by the increased study
of Nature, ought to be included in any scheme of instruction intended
to fit men for the struggle of modern life, and that in this newer
knowledge much might be found to minister to the highest ends of
education. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that utilitarian considerations
have not been wholly absent from the minds of the reformers.
Science has many and far-reaching practical applications.
It has called into existence many new trades and professions, and has
greatly modified many of those of older date. In a thousand varied
ways it has come into the ordinary affairs of everyday life. Its cultivation
has brought innumerable material benefits; its neglect would
obviously entail many serious industrial disadvantages, and could not
fail to leave us behind in the commercial progress of the nations of
the globe.</p>

<p>So much have these considerations pressed upon the attention
of the public in recent years that, besides all the other educational
machinery to which I have referred, technical schools have been
established in many towns for the purpose of teaching the theory as
well as the practice of various arts and industries, and making artisans
understand the nature of the processes with which their trades are
concerned.</p>

<p>That this educational transformation, which has been advancing
during the century, has resulted in great benefit to the community at
large can hardly be denied. Besides the obvious material gains,
there has been a widening of the whole range and method of our
teaching; the old subjects are better, because more scientifically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>
taught, and the new subjects enlist the attention and sympathy of
large classes of pupils whom the earlier studies only languidly interested.
Nevertheless, it is incumbent on those who have advocated
and carried out this change to ask themselves whether it has brought
with it no drawbacks. They may be sure that no such extensive
reform could possibly be accomplished without defects appearing
somewhere. And it is well to look these defects in the face and, as
far as may be possible, remove them. In considering how I might
best discharge the duty with which I have been honored of addressing
the students of Mason College this evening, I have thought that
it might not be inappropriate if, as a representative of science, I were
to venture to point out some of the drawbacks as well as the advantages
of the position which science has attained in our educational
system.</p>

<p>At the outset no impartial onlooker can fail to notice that the
natural reaction against the dominance of the older learning has
tended to induce an undervaluing of the benefits which that learning
afforded and can still bestow. In this college, indeed, and in other
institutions more specially designed for instruction in science, provision
has also been made for the teaching of Latin, Greek, and the
more important modern languages and literatures. But in such institutions
these subjects usually hold only a subordinate place. It can
hardly be denied that generally throughout the country, even although
the literary side of education still maintains its pre-eminence
in our public schools and universities, it is losing ground, and that
every year it occupies less of the attention of students of science.
The range of studies which the science examinations demand is
always widening, while the academic period within which these
studies must be crowded undergoes no extension. Those students,
therefore, who, whether from necessity or choice, have taken their
college education in science, naturally experience no little difficulty
in finding time for the absolutely essential subjects required for their
degrees. Well may they declare that it is hopeless for them to attempt
to engage in anything more, and especially in anything that
will not tell directly on their places in the final class lists. With the
best will in the world, and with even, sometimes, a bent for literary
pursuits, they may believe themselves compelled to devote their
whole time and energies to the multifarious exactions of their science
curriculum.</p>

<p>Such a result of our latest reformation in education may be
unavoidable, but it is surely matter for regret. A training in science
and scientific methods, admirable as it is in so many ways, fails
to supply those humanizing influences which the older learning can
so well impart. For the moral stimulus that comes from an association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span>
with all that is noblest and best in the literatures of the past, for
the culture and taste that spring from prolonged contact with the
highest models of literary expression, for the widening of our sympathies
and the vivifying of our imagination by the study of history,
the teaching of science has no equivalents.</p>

<p>Men who have completed their formal education with little or
no help from the older learning may be pardoned should they be apt
to despise such help and to believe that they can very well dispense
with it in the race of life. My first earnest advice to the science
students of this college is, not to entertain this belief and to refuse
to act on it. Be assured that, in your future career, whatever it may
be, you will find in literature a source of solace and refreshment, of
strength and encouragement, such as no department of science can
give you. There will come times, even to the most enthusiastic
among you, when scientific work, in spite of its absorbing interest,
grows to be a weariness. At such times as these you will appreciate
the value of the literary culture you may have received at school or
college. Cherish the literary tastes you have acquired, and devote
yourselves sedulously to the further cultivation of them during such
intervals of leisure as you may be able to secure.</p>

<p>Over and above the pleasure which communion with the best
books will bring with it, two reasons of a more utilitarian kind may
be given to science students why they should seek this communion.
Men who have been too exclusively trained in science, or are too
much absorbed in its pursuit, are not always the most agreeable members
of society. They are apt to be somewhat angular and professional,
contributing little that is interesting to general conversation,
save when they get a chance of introducing their own science and
its doings. Perhaps the greatest bore I ever met was a man of science,
whose mind and training were so wholly mathematical and
physical that he seemed unable to look at the simplest subject save
in its physical relations, about which he would discourse till he had
long exhausted the patience of the auditor whom he detained. There
is no more efficacious remedy for this tendency to what is popularly
known as "shop" than the breadth and culture of mind that spring
from wide reading in ancient and modern literature.</p>

<p>The other reason for the advice I offer you is one of which you
will hardly, perhaps, appreciate the full force in the present stage
of your career. One result of the comparative neglect of the literary
side of education by many men of science is conspicuously seen in
their literary style. It is true that in our time we have had some
eminent scientific workers, who have also been masters of nervous
and eloquent English. But it is not less true that the literature of
science is burdened with a vast mass of slipshod, ungrammatical, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span>
clumsy writing, wherein sometimes even the meaning of the authors
is left in doubt. Let me impress upon you the obvious duty of not
increasing this unwieldy burden. Study the best masters of style,
and when once you have made up your minds what you want to
say, try to express it in the simplest, clearest, and most graceful language
you can find.</p>

<p>Remember that, while education is the drawing out and cultivation
of all the powers of the mind, no system has yet been devised
that will by itself develop with equal success every one of these
powers. The system under which we have been trained may have
done as much for us as it can do. Each of us is thereafter left to
supplement its deficiencies by self-culture. And in the ordinary
science instruction of the time one of the most obvious of these inevitable
deficiencies is the undue limitation or neglect of the literary
side of education.</p>

<p>But in the science instruction itself there are dangers regarding
which we can not be too watchful. In this college and in all the
other well-organized scientific institutions of the country the principles
of science are taught orally and experimentally. Every branch
of knowledge is expounded in its bearings on other branches. Its
theory is held up as the first great aim of instruction, and its practical
applications are made subsequent and subordinate. Divisions of science
are taught here which may have few practical applications, but
which are necessary for a comprehensive survey of the whole circle
of scientific truth. Now, you may possibly have heard, and in the
midst of a busy industrial community you are not unlikely to hear,
remarks made in criticism of this system or method of tuition. The
importance of scientific training will be frankly acknowledged and
even insisted upon, but you will sometimes hear this admission
coupled with the proviso that the science must be of a practical kind;
must, in short, be just such and no other as will fit young men to
turn it to practical use in the manufactures or industries to which
they may be summoned. The critics who make this limitation boast
that they are practical men, and that in their opinion theory is useless
or worse for the main purposes for which they would encourage and
support a great scientific school.</p>

<p>Now I am quite sure that those science students who have passed
even a single session in Mason College can see for themselves the
utter fallacy of such statements and the injury that would be done
to the practical usefulness of this institution and to the general progress
of the industrial applications of science if such short-sighted
views were ever carried into effect. There can be no thorough, adequate,
and effective training in science unless it be based on a comprehensive
study of facts and principles, altogether apart from any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span>
economic uses to which they may be put. Science must be pursued
for her own sake, in the first instance, and without reference to any
pecuniary benefits she may be able to confer. We never can tell
when the most theoretical part of pure science may be capable of
being turned to the most important practical uses. Who could have
surmised, for instance, that in the early tentative experiments of
Volta, Galvani, and others last century lay the germ of the modern
world-grasping electric telegraph? Or when Wedgwood, at the beginning
of this century, copied paintings by the agency of light
upon nitrate of silver, who could have foretold that he was laying the
foundations of the marvelous art of photography?</p>

<p>There can be no more pernicious doctrine than that which would
measure the commercial value of science by its immediate practical
usefulness, and would restrict its place in education to those only of
its subdivisions which may be of service to the industries of the
present time. Such a curtailed method of instruction is not education
in the true sense of the term. It is only a kind of cramming for
a specific purpose, and the knowledge which it imparts, being one-sided
and imperfect, is of little value beyond its own limited range.
I by no means wish to undervalue the importance of technical instruction.
By all means let our artisans know as much as can be
taught them regarding the nature and laws of the scientific processes
in which they are engaged. But it is not by mere technical instruction
that we shall maintain and extend the industrial and commercial
greatness of the country. If we are not only to hold our own, but
to widen the boundaries of applied science, to perfect our manufactures,
and to bring new departments of Nature into the service of
man, it is by broad, thorough, untrammeled scientific research that
our success must be achieved.</p>

<p>When, therefore, you are asked to explain of what practical use
are some of the branches of science in which you have been trained,
do not lose patience with your questioner, and answer him as you
think such a Philistine deserves to be answered. Give him a few
illustrations of the thousands of ways in which science, that might
have been stigmatized by him as merely abstract and theoretical, has
yet been made to minister to the practical needs of humanity. Above
all, urge him to attend some of the classes of Mason College, where
he will learn, in the most effectual manner, the intimate connection
between theory and practice. If he chances to be wealthy, the experiment
may possibly open his eyes to the more urgent needs of the
institution, and induce him to contribute liberally toward their satisfaction.</p>

<p>Among the advantages and privileges of your life at college there
is one, the full significance and value of which you will better appreciate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span>
in later years. You have here an opportunity of acquiring a
wide general view of the whole range of scientific thought and
method. If you proceed to a science degree you are required to lay
a broad foundation of acquaintance with the physical and biological
sciences. You are thus brought into contact with the subjects of each
great department of natural knowledge, and you learn enough regarding
them to enable you to understand their scope and to sympathize
with the workers who are engaged upon them. But when your
academical career is ended, no such chance of wide general training
is ever likely to be yours again. You will be dragged into the whirl
of life, where you will probably find little time or opportunity to
travel much beyond the sphere of employment to which you may
have been called. Make the most, therefore, of the advantages which
in this respect you meet with here. Try to insure that your acquaintance
with each branch of science embraced in your circle of studies
shall be as full and accurate as lies in your power to make it. Even
in departments outside the bounds of your own tastes and ultimate
requirements, do not neglect the means provided for your gaining
some knowledge of them. I urge this duty, not because its diligent
discharge will obviously tell in your examinations, but because it will
give you that scientific culture which, while enabling you to appreciate
and enjoy the successive advances of other sciences than that
which you may select for special cultivation, will at the same time
increase your general usefulness and aid you in your own researches.</p>

<p>The days of Admirable Crichtons are long since past. So rapid
and general is the onward march of science that not only can no man
keep pace with it in every direction, but it has become almost hopelessly
impossible to remain abreast of the progress in each of the several
subdivisions of even a single science. We are entering more and
more upon the age of specialists. It grows increasingly difficult for
the specialists, even in kindred sciences, to remain in touch with each
other. When you find yourselves fairly launched into the vortex
of life you will look back with infinite satisfaction to the time when
you were enabled to lay a broad and solid platform of general acquirement
within the walls of this college.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable defect in the older or literary
methods of education was the neglect of the faculty of observation.
For the training of the other mental faculties ample provision was
made, but for this, one of the most important of the whole, no care
was taken. If a boy was naturally observant, he was left to cultivate
the use of his eyes as he best might; if he was not observant, nothing
was done to improve him in this respect, unless it were, here and
there, by the influence of such an intelligent teacher as is described
in Mrs. Barbauld's famous story of Eyes and No Eyes. Even when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span>
science began to be introduced into our schools, it was still taught in
the old or literary fashion. Lectures and lessons were given by
masters who got up their information from books, but had no practical
knowledge of the subjects they taught. Class-books were
written by men equally destitute of a personal acquaintance with
any department of science. The lessons were learned by rote, and
not infrequently afforded opportunities rather for frolic than for instruction.
Happily, this state of things, though not quite extinct,
is rapidly passing away. Practical instruction is everywhere coming
into use, while the old-fashioned cut-and-dry lesson-book is giving
way to the laboratory, the field excursion, and the school museum.</p>

<p>It is mainly through the eyes that we gain our knowledge and
appreciation of the world in which we live. But we are not all
equally endowed with the gift of intelligent vision. On the contrary,
in no respect, perhaps, do we differ more from each other than
in our powers of observation. Obviously, a man who has a quick
eye to note what passes around him must, in the ordinary affairs of
life, stand at a considerable advantage over another man who moves
unobservantly on his course. We can not create an observing faculty
any more than we can create a memory, but we may do much to develop
both. This is a feature in education of much more practical
and national importance than might be supposed. I suspect that it
lies closer than might be imagined to the success of our commercial
relations abroad. Our prevalent system of instruction has for generations
past done nothing to cultivate the habit of observation, and
has thus undoubtedly left us at a disadvantage in comparison with
nations that have adopted methods of tuition wherein the observing
faculty is regularly trained. With our world-wide commerce we
have gone on supplying to foreign countries the same manufactured
goods for which our fathers found markets in all quarters of the
globe. Our traders, however, now find themselves in competition
with traders from other nations who have been trained to better use
of their powers of observation, and who, taking careful note of the
gradually changing tastes and requirements of the races which they
visit, have been quick to report these changes and to take means for
meeting them. Thus, in our own centers of trade, we find ourselves
in danger of being displaced by rivals with sharper eyes and greater
powers of adaptation.</p>

<p>It is the special function of science to cultivate this faculty of
observation. Here in Mason College, from the very beginning of
your scientific studies you have been taught to use your eyes, to
watch the phenomena that appear and disappear around you, to note
the sequence and relation of these phenomena, and thus, as it were,
to enter beneath the surface into the very soul of things. You can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span>
not, however, have failed to remark among your fellow-students great
inequalities in their powers of observation, and great differences in
the development of these powers under the very same system of instruction.
And you may have noticed that, speaking generally, those
classmates who have shown the best observing faculty have taken
foremost places among their fellows. It is not a question of mere
brain power. A man may possess a colossal intellect, while his faculty
of observation may be of the feeblest kind. One of the greatest
mathematicians of this century who, full of honors, recently passed
away from us, had so little cognizance of his surroundings that many
ludicrous stories are told of his childlike mistakes as to place and
time.</p>

<p>The continued development of the faculty of prompt and accurate
observation is a task on which you can not bestow too much
attention. Your education here must already have taught you its
value. In your future career the use you make of this faculty may
determine your success or your failure. But not only have your
studies in this college trained your observing powers, they have at
the same time greatly widened the range of your mental vision by the
variety of objects which you have been compelled to look at and
examine. The same methods which have been so full of benefit to
you here can be continued by you in after life. And be assured that
in maintaining them in active use you will take effective means for
securing success in the careers you may choose to follow.</p>

<p>But above and beyond the prospect of any material success there
is a higher motive which will doubtless impel you. The education
of your observing faculty has been carried on during your introduction
to new realms of knowledge. The whole domain of Nature has
been spread out before you. You have been taught to observe thousands
of objects and processes of which, common though they may
be, you had previously taken no note. Henceforth, wherever you
may go, you can not wander with ignorant or unobservant eyes.
Land and sea and sky, bird and beast and flower now awaken in you
a new interest, for you have learned lessons from them that have
profoundly impressed you, and you have discovered meanings in
them of which you had never dreamed. You have been permitted to
pass within the veil of Nature, and to perceive some of the inner
mechanism of this world.</p>

<p>Thus, your training in science has not only taught you to use
your eyes, but to use them intelligently, and in such a way as to
see much more in the world around you than is visible to the uninstructed
man. This widened perception might be illustrated from
any department of natural science. Let me take, by way of example,
the relation of the student of science toward the features and charms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>
of landscape. It may be said that no training is needed to comprehend
these beauties; that the man in the street, the holiday maker
from town, is just as competent as the man of science to appreciate
them, and may get quite as much pleasure out of them. We need not
stop to discuss the relative amounts of enjoyment which different
orders of spectators may derive from scenery; but obviously the
student of science has one great advantage in this matter. Not only
can he enjoy to the full all the outward charms which appeal to the
ordinary eye, but he sees in the features of the landscape new charms
and interests which the ordinary untrained eye can not see. Your
accomplished professor of geology has taught you the significance of
the outer lineaments of the land. While under his guidance you
have traced with delight the varied features of the lovely landscapes
of the Midlands, your eyes have been trained to mark their connection
with each other, and their respective places in the ordered symmetry
of the whole scene. You perceive why there is here a height
and there a hollow; you note what has given the ridges and vales
their dominant forms and directions; you detect the causes that have
spread out a meadow in one place and raised up a hill in another.</p>

<p>Above and beyond all questions as to the connection and origin
of its several parts, the landscape appeals vividly to your imagination.
You know that it has not always worn the aspect which it presents to-day.
You have observed in these ridges proofs that the sea once
covered their site. You have seen the remains of long-extinct shells,
fishes, and reptiles that have been disinterred from the mud and silt
left behind by the vanished waters. You have found evidence that
not once only, but again and again, after vast lapses of time and
many successive revolutions, the land has sunk beneath the ocean
and has once more emerged. You have been shown traces of underground
commotion, and you can point to places where, over central
England, volcanoes were once active. You have learned that the
various elements of the landscape have thus been gradually put together
during successive ages, and that the slow processes, whereby
the characteristic forms of the ground have been carved out, are still
in progress under your eye.</p>

<p>While, therefore, you are keenly alive to the present beauty of
the scene, it speaks to you, at every turn, of the past. Each feature
recalls some incident in the strange primeval history that has been
transacted here. The succession of contrasts between what is now
and what has been fills you with wonder and delight. You feel as
if a new sense had been given to you, and that with its aid your appreciation
of scenery has been enlarged and deepened to a marvelous
degree.</p>

<p>And so, too, is it with your relation to all the other departments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span>
of Nature. The movements of the clouds, the fall of rain, the flow of
brook and river, the changes of the seasons, the succession of calm
and storm, do not pass before your eyes now as they once did. While
they minister to the joy of life, they speak to you of that all-embracing
system of process and law that governs the world. The wayside
flower is no longer to your eyes merely a thing of beauty. You have
found it to be that and far more&mdash;an exquisite organism in which the
several parts are admirably designed to promote the growth of the
plant and to perpetuate the life of the species. Every insect and
bird is now to you an embodiment of the mystery of life. The forces
of Nature, once so dark and so dreaded, are now seen by you to be
intelligible, orderly, and capable of adaptation to the purposes of man.
In the physical and chemical laboratories you have been brought into
personal contact with these forces, and have learned to direct their
operations, as you have watched the manifold effects of energy on
the infinite varieties of matter.</p>

<p>When you have completed your course of study and leave this
college, crowned, I hope, with academic distinction, there will be
your future career in life to choose and follow. A small number
among you may, perhaps, be so circumstanced as to be able to devote
yourselves entirely to original scientific research, selecting such
branches of inquiry as may have specially interested you here, and
giving up your whole time and energy to investigation. A much
larger number will, no doubt, enter professions where a scientific
training can be turned to practical account, and you may become
engineers, chemists, or medical men. But in the struggle for existence,
which every year grows keener among us, these professions are
more and more crowded, so that a large proportion of your ranks may
not succeed in finding places there, and may in the end be pushed
into walks in life where there may be little or no opportunity for
making much practical use of the knowledge in science which you
have gained here. To those who may ultimately be thus situated it
will always be of advantage to have had the mental training given
in this institution, and it will probably be your own fault if, even
under unfavorable conditions, you do not find, from time to time,
chances of turning your scientific acquirements to account. Your
indebtedness to your professors demands that you shall make the
effort, and, for the credit of the college, you are bound to do
your best.</p>

<p>Among the mental habits which your education in science has
helped to foster, there are a few which I would specially commend
to your attention as worthy of your most sedulous care all
through life.</p>

<p>In the first place, I would put accuracy. You have learned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span>
the laboratory how absolutely essential this condition is for scientific
investigation. We are all supposed to make the ascertainment of
the truth our chief aim, but we do not all take the same trouble to
attain it. Accuracy involves labor, and every man is not gifted with
an infinite capacity for taking pains. Inexactness of observation is
sure sooner or later to be detected, and to be visited on the head of
the man who commits it. If his observations are incorrect, the conclusions
he has drawn from them may be vitiated. Thus all the toil
he has endured in a research may be rendered of no avail, and the
reputation he might have gained is not only lost but replaced by discredit.
It is quite true that absolute accuracy is often unattainable;
you can only approach it. But the greater the exertion you make
to reach it, the greater will be the success of your investigations.
The effort after accuracy will be transferred from your scientific
work to your everyday life and become a habit of mind, advantageous
both to yourselves and to society at large.</p>

<p>In the next place, I would set thoroughness, which is closely
akin to accuracy. Again, your training here has shown you how
needful it is in scientific research to adopt thorough and exhaustive
methods of procedure. The conditions to be taken into account are
so numerous and complex, the possible combinations so manifold,
before a satisfactory conclusion can be reached. A laborious collection
of facts must be made. Each supposed fact must be sifted out
and weighed. The evidence must be gone over again and yet again,
each link in its chain being scrupulously tested. The deduction to
which the evidence may seem to point must be closely and impartially
scrutinized, every other conceivable explanation of the facts
being frankly and fully considered. Obviously the man whose education
has inured him to the cultivation of a mental habit of this
kind is admirably equipped for success in any walk in life which he
may be called upon to enter. The accuracy and thoroughness which
you have learned to appreciate and practice at college must never be
dropped in later years. Carry them with you as watchwords, and
make them characteristic of all your undertakings.</p>

<p>In the third place, we may take breadth. At the outset of your
scientific education you were doubtless profoundly impressed by the
multiplicity of detail which met your eye in every department of
natural knowledge. When you entered upon the study of one of
these departments, you felt, perhaps, almost overpowered and bewildered
by the vast mass of facts with which you had to make
acquaintance. And yet as your training advanced, you gradually
came to see that the infinite variety of phenomena could all be marshaled,
according to definite laws, into groups and series. You were
led to look beyond the details to the great principles that underlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</a></span>
them and bind them into a harmonious and organic whole. With
the help of a guiding system of classification, you were able to see
the connection between the separate facts, to arrange them according
to their mutual relations, and thus to ascend to the great general laws
under which the material world has been constructed. With all
attainable thoroughness in the mastery of detail, you have been taught
to combine a breadth of treatment which enables you to find and
keep a leading clew even through the midst of what might seem a
tangled web of confusion. There are some men who can not see the
wood for the trees, and who consequently can never attain great success
in scientific investigation. Let it be your aim to master fully
the details of the tree, and yet to maintain such a breadth of vision
as will enable you to embrace the whole forest within your ken. I
need not enlarge on the practical value of this mental habit in everyday
life, nor point out the excellent manner in which a scientific
education tends to develop it.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, I would inculcate the habit of wide reading
in scientific literature. Although the progress of science is now too
rapid for any man to keep pace with the advance of all its departments,
you should try to hold yourselves in touch with at least the
main results arrived at in other branches than your own; while, in
that branch itself, it should be your constant aim to watch every
onward step that is taken by others, and not to fall behind the van.
This task you will find to be no light one. Even were it confined to
a survey of the march of science in your own country, it would be
arduous enough to engage much of your time. But science belongs
to no country, and continues its onward advance all over the globe.
If you would keep yourselves informed regarding this progress in
other countries, as you are bound to do if you would not willingly be
left behind, you will need to follow the scientific literature of those
countries. You must be able to read at least French and German.
You will find in these languages a vast amount of scientific work
relating to your own department, and to this accumulated pile of
published material the journals of every month continue to add. In
many ways it is a misfortune that the literature of science increases
so fast; but we must take the evil with the good. Practice will
eventually enable you to form a shrewd judgment as to which authors
or papers you may skip without serious danger of losing any valuable
fact or useful suggestion.</p>

<p>In the fifth place, let me plead for the virtue of patience. In a
scientific career we encounter two dangers, for the avoidance of which
patience is our best support and guide. When life is young and enthusiasm
is boundless; when from the details which we may have
laboriously gathered together we seem to catch sight of some new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span>
fact or principle, some addition of more or less importance to the sum
of human knowledge, there may come upon us the eager desire to
make our discovery known. We may long to be allowed to add our
own little stone to the growing temple of science. We may think
of the pride with which we should see our names enrolled among
those of the illustrious builders by whom this temple has been slowly
reared since the infancy of mankind. So we commit our observations
to writing, and send them for publication. Eventually we obtain the
deep gratification of appearing in print among well-known authors
in science. Far be it from me to condemn this natural desire for
publicity. But, as your experience grows, you will probably come
to agree with me that if the desire were more frequently and energetically
curbed, scientific literature would gain much thereby.
There is among us far too much hurry in publication. We are so
afraid lest our observations or deductions should be forestalled&mdash;so
anxious not to lose our claim to priority, that we rush before the
world, often with a half-finished performance, which must be corrected,
supplemented, or canceled by some later communication.
It is this feverish haste which is largely answerable for the mass of
jejune, ill-digested, and erroneous matter that cumbers the pages of
modern scientific journals. Here it is that you specially need patience.
Before you venture to publish anything, take the utmost
pains to satisfy yourselves that it is true, that it is new, and that it is
worth putting into print. And be assured that this reticence, while
it is a kindness to the literature of science, will most certainly bring
with it its own reward to yourselves. It will increase your confidence,
and make your ultimate contributions more exact in their
facts as well as more accurate and convincing in their argument.</p>

<p>The other danger to which I referred as demanding patience is of
an opposite kind. As we advance in our career, and the facts of our
investigations accumulate around us, there will come times of depression
when we seem lost in a labyrinth of detail out of which
no path appears to be discoverable. We have, perhaps, groped our
way through this maze, following now one clew, now another, that
seemed to promise some outlet to the light. But the darkness has
only closed around us the deeper, and we feel inclined to abandon the
research as one in which success is, for us at least, unattainable.
When this blankness of despair shall come upon you, take courage
under it, by remembering that a patient study of any department of
Nature is never labor thrown away. Every accurate observation
you have made, every new fact you have established, is a gain to
science. You may not for a time see the meaning of these observations,
nor the connection of these facts. But their meaning and connection
are sure in the end to be made out. You have gone through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</a></span>
the labor necessary for the ascertainment of truth, and if you patiently
and watchfully bide your time, the discovery of the truth
itself may reward your endurance and your toil.</p>

<p>It is by failures as well as by successes that the true ideal of the
man of science is reached. The task allotted to him in life is one
of the noblest that can be undertaken. It is his to penetrate into
the secrets of Nature, to push back the circumference of darkness
that surrounds us, to disclose ever more and more of the limitless
beauty, harmonious order, and imperious law that extend throughout
the universe. And while he thus enlarges our knowledge, he shows
us also how Nature may be made to minister in an ever-augmenting
multiplicity of ways to the service of humanity. It is to him and
his conquests that the material progress of our race is mainly due. If
he were content merely to look back over the realms which he has
subdued, he might well indulge in jubilant feelings, for his peaceful
victories have done more for the enlightenment and progress of mankind
than were ever achieved by the triumphs of war. But his eye
is turned rather to the future than to the past. In front of him rises
the wall of darkness that shrouds from him the still unknown. What
he has painfully accomplished seems to him but little in comparison
with the infinite possibilities that lie beyond. And so he presses
onward, not self-satisfied and exultant, but rather humbled and
reverential, yet full of hope and courage for the work of further conquest
that lies before him.&mdash;<i>Nature.</i></p>

<h2>SHALL WE TEACH OUR DAUGHTERS THE VALUE OF MONEY?</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By ALEXANDRA L. B. IDE.</span></p>


<p>I am induced to write a few lines on this subject by a remark
recently made to me by a widow of large property. In speaking
about the management of her money she said: "As to myself,
I leave everything to my business man or agent. I would
not know if my tax bills were correct. He gives me plenty of
money to spend on my charities; why should I trouble myself
about the details?" Evidently it had never occurred to her that
she might be spending her principal; that some day she might
wake up to the fact that her fortune had been dissipated. Another
rich woman, to whom I made the remark that certain bonds were
bought at par, inquired, "Is that the same thing as buying them on
a margin?" Now here were representative women of New York
society, both belonging to excellent families, and to all appearances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span>
well educated. It is amazing that such profound ignorance on
ordinary business matters exists. In conversation with many other
wealthy women I discovered that it was very much the exception to
find a woman who possessed the slightest knowledge of money matters.</p>

<p>Now, why should these things be? The time has passed for a
young girl to be brought up a "perfect fool." Let her not waste
the beautiful morning of her life in profitless and frivolous occupations.
The reason often given as excuse for the ignorance of many
women is, so few comparatively have any money to keep, therefore
it is useless to teach them.</p>

<p>True, it is unusual to find a young girl with an independent
fortune; but she may marry rich, and what a help she would be to
a sensible man if she were capable of aiding him in his business
affairs! Again, she might be left a widow, and have the entire direction
of her husband's property. No knowledge is ever lost. The
more one knows, the more one realizes how little one does know. I
maintain that a woman's intellect is perfectly capable of coping with
and understanding business affairs. In some matters she is far
shrewder than the average man, and in many cases her quick insight
sees at a glance that which man requires time to penetrate. Only
give her half a chance. I do not wish for a moment to be understood
as advocating women becoming stockbrokers or lawyers; nothing
could be more unnatural or unsuitable. It seems to me only in
accordance with the wishes of a reasonable woman to participate
with her brothers in such rudimentary knowledge as will enable her
to oversee or take the entire charge of her own property. Take, for
example, a well-to-do New York business man. He has acquired
through his own industry and shrewdness a large fortune. He maps
out the education for his children. His sons are sent to the best
schools, and afterward to college. He determines that no expense
shall be spared to fit them for their future career.</p>

<p>For his daughters expensive foreign governesses are engaged,
who teach them the languages, music, and other accomplishments.
Or the daughters are sent to some high-priced fashionable school,
where they are put through a course of training to enable them to
"shine in society." Having reached the age of eighteen, the daughter
returns to the parental roof.</p>

<p>What does she know in exchange for the large sum of money her
education has cost? Usually her penmanship is bad and illegible.
Her knowledge of arithmetic very slight. These two essentials of
education are not her forte.</p>

<p>But she is a good dancer, and perhaps at the assembly or some such
function the father's heart has swelled with pride as he noticed
how eagerly she was sought as a partner. She can sing French songs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span>
probably those which are rather <i>risqu&eacute;</i>. She can converse, perhaps,
in two or three different modern languages. As a general rule
her French can scarcely be understood by the foreign <i>attach&eacute;s</i> at
Newport. The girl is absolutely unequipped for <i>real</i> life, and the
man of sense, who has passed the boyish age and is looking for a
partner for life, knows <i>this</i>. Possibly this is one cause why there are
comparatively few marriages in our best society. What man is less
likely to seek as wife a woman who knows something about the
care and value of money? It is strange that a father should be so
blinded to the best interests of his daughter. Is it because he considers
her intellect so far below that of his son that he makes no
effort to instruct her in regard to the care of money? The only thing
she knows about money is how to spend it&mdash;generally on herself, for
clothes and jewels. Perhaps on the first of the month, when the bills
for his daughter's extravagance pour in on him, he is vexed; but if
his fortune is large, and it is no inconvenience for him to pay them,
he generally does so without a murmur. "Let her have a good time
while she is young," he soliloquizes.</p>

<p>But stop a moment and consider. What you sow you reap is as
true in this material concern as in the world of agriculture. The
fond parent by his indulgence and neglect is sowing the seeds of
extravagance, perhaps those of want. Years hence she may reap
the fruit of his ill-judged kindness in fostering habits of reckless
expenditure.</p>

<p>In a few years the father dies; his property is divided; the
daughter receives her share. If she is married to a good business
man who has time to take charge of her fortune, possibly, during her
husband's lifetime, the difficulty is bridged over. But the chances
are she may not be married, or again the man she has selected as
husband may be worthless as a business man. It is not to be expected
that a brother (even if she is fortunate enough to possess one),
however kind, will overburden himself with the manifold details
of looking after the property of a sister. He has his own interests,
which demand his attention. He thinks his duty accomplished when
he has chosen a man to look after his sister's affairs whom he <i>believes</i>
to be reliable. The person whom he has appointed as guardian over
his sister's interests may have an honest and high character, but that
is no guarantee that in a moment of weakness he may not yield to
the temptation of abusing the trust. He knows the woman is absolutely
ignorant of how her affairs are being conducted, and in all
probability would not be the wiser if he appropriated some of her
fortune to his own uses. Her very ignorance is his security. Who
can not recall several such cases? If each day for half an hour the
father had instructed his child in the essentials of business&mdash;how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span>
calculate interest quickly, the manner of filling out a lease in renting
property, explaining about mortgages, and giving her a lesson as to
what were the best investments&mdash;she would know enough to steer
clear of the many sharks and vultures which usually find her a
ready prey. The woman who does not know the difference between
a registered and coupon bond should be ashamed to acknowledge
such ignorance. A parent's neglect in teaching his child about
monetary affairs is culpable, almost amounting to a crime. There is
nothing so costly as ignorance. This very fortune which you have
taken infinite pains to accumulate will be perhaps dissipated, owing
to your want of forethought in imparting the requisite knowledge
to your child. This information she will in after years buy for
herself at a heavy premium. If knowledge is power in other matters,
it is more than ever true in monetary affairs. Power to keep your
fortune is a power worth having, and more difficult to acquire than to
make a fortune. Let a girl but try to earn five dollars, and she will see
the task is not an easy one. Then, unless she be a fool, she will realize
that what is so difficult to obtain should not be wasted.</p>

<p>I recall the case of a fashionable woman in New York society
which came under my own observation. Her husband told me he
had deposited in a bank a large sum of money for his wife to draw
on, given her a bank and check book, explained and showed her how
to draw checks. He very sensibly thought that it would be a far
better plan for her to pay her bills herself, instead of coming to
him every time she needed money. His relief from being her almoner
was of short duration, for in less than a month she came to him, and,
throwing the check and bank books on his library table, told him it
was too much trouble&mdash;she could not make head or tail of it; she
wished to return to the old system! He could pay her bills in
future. This woman had been married twenty years. Too much
trouble, is it? Yes, I believe this is the keynote why women are
so ignorant. They are lazy, pure and simple. The details of business
are too dry and uninteresting. It is so much easier to have some one
else do the work for you. So much less exertion to read a novel,
or ride the wheel with some attractive man. "How prosaic," you
say, "to add up account books, balance check books, and calculate
whether your tax bill is correct when your property is assessed at the
rate of 2.01!"</p>

<p>I believe, if the truth were told, half the divorces in which the
reason given is incompatibility of temper arise from the fact that
women know nothing of the value of money. I am not speaking
entirely of women who have their own property, but also of those
who are dependent on a husband's income. The wife has a vague idea
that there is an inexhaustible supply of cash somewhere! What man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span>
can not tell you how worried and harassed he felt when his wife came
to him for money to spend on nonessentials, and which he could ill
afford? If he attempted to remonstrate with her he probably received
a rude or angry reply! The wife, perhaps, had been used to
an indulgent father, who gratified her every whim. She overlooks
the fact that a father and husband are two vastly different beings,
and require different treatment. To some women a husband's value
decreases when he can no longer supply them with finery. Their
alleged love soon wanes, and a divorce is sought on any pretext.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that by a knowledge of business affairs a woman
can dispense with the services of an agent or trust company, whose
salary thus being saved is added to her income. In case a woman
is fitted by a proper education for so doing, who could attend to
her own interests better than herself, as she is the party interested?
The phrase, "If you wish anything well done, do it yourself," is
never better exemplified than in this case. Lastly, but not least, in
saving our money it need not be from a miserly spirit; but the
more we have, the more we can profitably give away. What pleasure
equals that of relieving real distress, and of helping others? Did not
our Saviour himself set the example of saving when, after performing
the miracle where he fed the multitude with the loaves and fishes,
he said: "Gather up the fragments that remain. Let nothing be
lost."</p>

<h2>SKETCH OF CL&Eacute;MENCE ROYER.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By M. JACQUES BOYER.</span></p>


<p>Madame Cl&eacute;mence Augustine Royer was born at
Nantes, France, April 21, 1830, of an old Catholic family.
When she reached a suitable age she was sent to school at the Sacr&eacute;
C&oelig;ur, where she received the most of her education. Very shortly
after coming out of the convent she abandoned the religious doctrines
they had tried to inculcate in her there, and, like so many young
persons, was attracted to poetry. But her literary efforts as a whole
received very little attention, and she would never have been successful
if she had only teased the Muse. Happily, she applied herself,
about 1850, to more serious studies, and went to England, where she
spent several years and acquired a thorough knowledge of the language
of Shakespeare. She removed thence to Switzerland, and there
found her definite vocation. The natural sciences, philosophy, and
political economy from that time engaged her attention.</p>

<p>The opening of Madame Royer's course of lectures to women on
logic at Lausanne in the winter of 1859 and 1860 attracted much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</a></span>
notice. The first lecture was published under the title of an Introduction
to Philosophy, and brought most flattering praise to the
author from contemporary students. In an animated style the disciple
of Jean Jacques Rousseau, the apostle of bold and ingenious
ideas, was already beginning to declare herself. In the meantime
she collaborated on the journal The New Economist, which the historian
and sociologist Pascal Duprat had just founded.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>At the close of 1860, the Canton of Vaud having opened a competition
on the Principles of Taxation, "the little lady with a straw
hat," as her neighbors familiarly called her, handled the subject so
thoroughly that her memoir, entitled <i>Th&eacute;orie de l'Imp&ocirc;t et Dime
sociale</i> (Theory of the Impost and Social Tithe, 1862), won her the
honor of dividing the prize with Proudhon. While not all the ideas
set forth in this work were new, she took care at least to co-ordinate
the systems of her predecessors, to select from the one and the other
of them what was good in them, and to condense into a homogeneous
whole works which were scattered hither and thither. But we will
pass over these books of her youth to dwell more at large on that part
of her work which will assure Madame Royer an honorable place
among the most zealous promoters and ablest defenders of the Darwinian
theories.</p>

<p>Her first effort in this line was to translate into French, in 1862,
the Origin of Species of the great English naturalist, preceding the
work with a preface which in itself alone constituted an excellent summary
of the doctrine of evolution. She pointed out the results which
logically follow from the transformist theory. She did not conceal
from herself that in doing thus she would be the object of attacks
from the immobilist and ecclesiastical parties still so numerous thirty
years ago in all civilized countries; but she flattered herself, too, and
with just reason, that she would furnish the liberals and progressives
of France with a powerful weapon. In this introductory chapter
she characterized the original and strong personality of Darwin in
appropriate terms, saying: "While he has not the brilliant qualities
of a Cuvier as a writer or a professor, he is at least a worthy heir of
the profoundly philosophical science of the two Geoffroys Saint-Hilaire
... one of those workmen who cut their stone with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span>
indefatigable courage. But there are also thicker and heavier stones,
without beauty or apparent grace, which are designed to be hidden
at the base of an immense edifice, like the massive columns with
which the architects of the middle ages decorated the crypts of their
Gothic cathedrals. It is truth in the rough. He does not impose his
condition, but communicates it and proves it. If it is certain, he
affirms it; when he supposes, he says so; when he doubts, he acknowledges
it." She then passes to the exposition of Darwinism as responding
to one of the noblest aspirations of the mind, the preliminary
step to the accounting for the world of organized beings, as
astronomy, physics, and geology have explained the origin of inanimate
substances. In effect, the illustrious Englishman, connecting
the domain of botany and zo&ouml;logy with the action of second causes,
sought first to comprehend the genesis, and then the evolution, in
the same way that astronomers and geologists teach us concerning the
origin of our globe and the successive phases through which its surface
has passed.</p>

<p>Not only did Madame Cl&eacute;mence Royer initiate us into transformism.
In her masterly introduction she went still further. Carrying
the exposition to its final consequences, she provoked a useful
revolution in the ideas then current. She dared to say what many
men of science would only have left to be inferred. Her translation,
revealing the name of Darwin to the French public, who hardly knew
of it at that period, gave the occasion for a very active conflict between
the partisans of "creationism" and the Nantese philosophy. The success
of this work was so great as to induce her to complete her preface
by publishing a few years afterward a work wholly her own, <i>Origine
de l'Homme et des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s</i> (Origin of Man and Societies, 1870),
which, being her best production, deserves a special analysis. With
the assistance of documents collected by the most famous anthropologists,
Madame Royer reconstitutes the history of the primitive ages
of mankind, and after studying its origins and development she seeks
for the bonds that connect the great human family with the rest of
living Nature; and finally forecasts its future from its past.</p>

<p>In the first part she takes up the question of the origin of life
and of its transformations upon the earth. The living species are
grouped around man, who is the topmost shoot of the gigantic "tree
of life." Two laws regulate the transmission of life&mdash;the law of
heredity and the law of variability. The former assures the continuation
of the type, and the latter variety in its modifications. The
organic kingdom as a whole oscillates between these two contrary
rules which fix limits each upon the other and which suffice to explain
the successive appearance through the ages of different forms of life.
The organic individual is thus the solution of a problem in algebra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span>
set to Nature. Atavism is the constant quantity, and the force of
variation is the perpetually changing unknown factor. The problem
is therefore complex, but the principles to which the variable is
subject resolve themselves into a series of partial laws which are deduced
from an aggregate of observations, and which, according to
our author, one may summarize as he goes.</p>

<p>Most of the variations reveal themselves in the embryo during the
f&aelig;tal period. But after its birth the young product is affected not
only by the ambient medium, but also by the consequences of the
reproductive act. The latter, in fact, having impressed the initial
movement upon its organism, reacts incessantly against the modifying
influences of the ambient, and atavism prevails as always the
resultant unless important accidents come in to change the course.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to add a few experimental considerations to
complete a rapid sketch of the laws of variability. First, correlation
of growth: Homologous organs tend to vary in the same direction,
and together. Are the fingers joined or divided? The hand follows
similar variations. Then there is a compensation of growth which
prevents the excess of the preceding rule; when one organ is developed,
another is atrophied. Also vital competition. Every organized
being must be in harmony with the conditions of its existence
or it will not subsist; the monster may appear, but will not live.
Lastly, by virtue of natural selection, the individual must likewise
possess the means of perpetuating its species. Otherwise, a series of
transformations will come to pass in the course of successive generations,
improving the organism and adapting it more and more to the
exigencies of its habitat. The least prolific species of to-day fulfill
these conditions so well that they of themselves alone would cover the
surface of the earth if their multiplication was not checked by that
of other species. But as only a limited quantity of life is possible on
our planet, the less well-adapted organisms perish. The struggle
therefore produces a selection. It is hence presumed that in the same
species only varieties manifesting tendencies in most complete harmony
with the method of their existence will be preserved, all
the intermediate varieties being destroyed. Consequently, if we
push the doctrine of Darwin to its extreme limits, we arrive at the
idea, now rejected, that in the beginning only a single germ arose at
one point on the globe. All the analogies, on the other hand, lead us
to suppose that the earth was fruitful over its entire surface.</p>

<p>This leads us to inquire how life appeared on the earth. The debate
between the heterogenists and the panspermists has been long
vain, because the question has been laid before them in insoluble terms.
In order to resolve it, therefore, we must take ourselves back in
thought thousands of thousands of centuries in the past. A thin crust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span>
of red-hot lava, hardly solidified, extended over the incandescent
nucleus of our globe. An eternity then passed before the fiery sphere
was forever confined within its coffin of granite. The metalloids dominant
in this chaos of affinities and repulsions were then floating in an
irrespirable atmosphere along with a mass of aqueous vapors. At
the end of many millions of years, the waters definitely took their
place around the globe. But who can ever tell what useless abortions,
to be destroyed as soon as they were created, arose in these oceans
saturated with anomalous substances? The first germs of life doubtless
arose from the thick proliferous stratum which was developed
under the pressure of a dense atmosphere in contact with liquids still
warm, incessantly traversed by electric currents of unimaginable intensity.
It was a sprout that arose everywhere at once. But in
those innumerable spontaneous efforts, continued during the enormous
length of time required to purify the atmosphere from its acrid
vapors and the seas from their foreign matters, only a small number
of these germs achieved a beginning of vegetation. This, according
to Madame Royer's theory, was the way life began on the globe.</p>

<p>The author next examines the complete series of the phases of evolution
gone through by the species, and then the development of the
mental faculties, the chief feature of difference which in the view
of some thinkers creates a gap between man and the rest of the animal
kingdom. She demonstrates that the primary qualities of mind are
identical in all living creatures, even in those of least development.
The intelligence of man is simply superior to the mental organism
of the animal. This is, however, only a relative superiority, not
differing in nature from the animal's intelligence, but only in form
and intensity.</p>

<p>After relating the history of man in prehistoric times, our philosopher
gives, in the second part of her work, the present picture of
the races as their physical characteristics and their social orders differentiate
them so profoundly: At the top, the white race, the last
flower of the genealogical tree, to which all the great nationalities
belong. By the side of it, its two diverging branches, the Turanians
(Hungarians, Finns, and Turks) and the Aram&aelig;ans or Semites
(Jews, Arabs, and Syrians). Then come the three&mdash;Hyperborean,
Mongolian, and Sinitic&mdash;branches of the yellow stock, who inhabit
eastern and northern Asia. We find also the Malays covering the
surface of the two southern peninsulas of Asia and Oceania. They
constitute a lateral ramification, which, together with the red or
copper-colored race of North America, may have had the same point
of departure as the Mongols. Lastly comes the negro race, which
has been separated a much longer time from the common stock from
which man has diverged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span></p>

<p>Further on, Madame Royer discusses the anatomical relations of
man and the ape, with the conclusion deduced as resulting from
phenomena of observation that the human family is only a term in
a series of which the different primates are the other steps. In short,
the further we go back in the past of primitive man, the more we
meet manifestations of passions as ferocious as base. This is, moreover,
easily conceivable. The savage, at war with Nature and his
like, and placed in conditions of life common to the animal world,
has in the beginning all its bad instincts.</p>

<p>The end of the second part of <i>L'Origine de l'Homme et des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s</i>
is devoted to the most complex problem of anthropology&mdash;that
of the beginning of speech and the origin of language. Man, in the
view of the author, first makes his wants and feelings known to other
beings by a series of signs. The three primordial faculties&mdash;feeling,
thinking, and wishing&mdash;were the point of departure, the cause and
the rule of all languages that man has created in his entire progress.
As his mind has shaped a new idea, it has found a new sign to express
it; but the process varying with the race, time and the environment
have produced the diversity of tongues which we observe. In the
beginning a more or less complicated cry suffices to express the
thought in its original syncretism. Then, under the influence of
reflection continued through ages, from generation to generation, it
becomes transformed and decomposed into various elements. Every
noun was primarily an adjective-substantive. For example, thunder
was designated by imitating it; the horse, by its neighing and the
sound of galloping. The relations of place, possession, and those of
many other kinds were probably expressed by the look, the attitude,
a motion with the hand, etc. Ideas of number were developed
slowly. The earliest languages contained only about a hundred
words, and these sufficed for centuries for the needs of human
thought, confined within the narrow experience of a generation. It
results from these facts that in every sense the formation of languages
is a consequence of social relations. But here rises a question
as important as difficult to answer: When did man begin to speak?
From the harmony between the anthropological classifications deduced
from philological research and those drawn from the labors
of the physiologists it appears evident that the spontaneous and primitive
constitution of the first elements of language was, among all
known human races, posterior to their geographical and ethnical
separation. In other words, local varieties had already been formed,
and men had acquired the anatomical differences that distinguish
them to-day before they conquered the faculty of speech. However
it may be with these hypotheses, we may assent fully to the conclusion
of the chapter that man will never deserve the name of the reasoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</a></span>
animal till he shall possess a logical and single language for all the
members of the great human association. May this dream be realized
by the destruction of the barriers which now divide so many
peoples!</p>

<p>In the third part of the work, Madame Royer treats of the development
of human society. Everything permits the supposition
that from a very remote period the anthropoid primate that served
as the root stock of man became omnivorous, with a predominance
of carnivorous tastes. These conditions of life therefore invoked an
at least rudimentary social instinct&mdash;that is, animals lived in troops
collected under chiefs, with a tactics for mutual defense. The most
ancient documents, in fact, show the human species living in rival
or allied tribes. Hunting and fishing were the principal business of
these primitive races, which relied for assistance at first on their
agility, muscular strength, and arms of stone of a workmanship still
in its infancy. Flint was then very roughly cut. But now a great advance
was achieved for man, a step toward industry and civilization.
This second stage was the discovery of fire, an immediate consequence
of the cutting of flints, when sparks would fly out at each blow. Yet
a later epoch probably had to be reached for the real employment of
fire in cooking food. Previous to that it could serve man only for
warming himself, or for protecting himself at night against wild
beasts.</p>

<p>Next came the earliest industries&mdash;the potter's art, the making
of rude clothing, and the construction of habitations; and about this
time the instinct of property begins to develop. For a long time there
are no other securities than force. On the other hand, the diversities
of the faculties, which are very unequally distributed among the
various races, and even among the different individuals of each of
them, create social inequalities, the chief cause of the crime, wars,
and misery with which every page of the history of man is soiled,
and from which the original organization of civil society sprang.</p>

<p>At the close of her treatise the eminent anthropologist states the
formula of the highest social prosperity: she believes that it resides
in an equal liberty for each member of a national collectivity and in
the free play of individual initiatives. Man will work in as large a
sphere of action as the right of another leaves him, striving to broaden
his place at the feast of life. Each one will climb the social ladder
in his own way and will fix himself on the step on which his aptitudes
will meet the best reward. Each individual will therefore gain a
large sum of well-being, and the species will possess a total maximum
of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Such, in broad outline, is the substance of this book, which naturalists
and philosophers have consulted now for many years. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span>
not within the province of our sketch to dwell upon any of the bold
assertions and hypotheses in it that have been invalidated by later
geological discoveries; and, notwithstanding a few errors in detail,
almost inevitable in a book of the kind, the <i>Origine de l'Homme</i> is,
as a whole, a work as vigorously thought out as clearly and generously
written.</p>

<p>Madame Cl&eacute;mence Royer has further occupied herself with special
researches on subjects of the same nature. Their results have been
published in the highly esteemed review, the Bulletin of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
d'Anthropologie. The most important of these memoirs relate to the
Craniology of the Quaternary Period, the Celts, the Origin of the
Different Human Races (1873), and the Domestication of Monkeys
(1887). The last work was published at the time of the appearance
of a book by M. Victor Meunier,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> a believer in the possibility of
domesticating the simian race. His proposition, received in France
as a kind of a joke, taxed the genius of the Parisian caricaturists,
because the author had suggested that newborn children be nursed
by monkeys, whose milk was most like that of the human mother.
Of course it was an easy subject to joke about. Madame Royer
showed how little originality there was in this book. We might,
she said, undoubtedly succeed in educating monkeys, and they would
at the end of many generations be in certain cases superior to the
dog and the horse. Unfortunately, the struggle for existence opposed
the adoption of the Utopian idea. The place for each human
recruit at the social table is now too narrow for any part of it to be
left for "our lower brethren."</p>

<p>Anthropological sciences were not the only ones to which the
encyclopedic mind of our learned philosopher was attracted. A few
years ago she returned to her earlier studies, and collaborated on the
<i>Nouveau Dictionnaire d'&Eacute;conomie Politique</i> of L&eacute;on Say (1891-'92).
The most profound article she wrote for this work was that
on the word positivism. According to it, the Positive Philosophy
dates, not from Auguste Comte, who is believed to have introduced
it, but from Bacon; for its essential features may be found in the
<i>Novum Organum</i> and the <i>Scientia nuova</i>. Furthermore, Madame
Royer found that Comte "emasculated" the doctrine of the famous
chancellor. The principal dogma of the system is the impossibility
of knowledge of first causes by our reason. This is an error, says
Madame Royer. Two distinct ideas have been confounded in the
term first causes: first, the permanent cause of phenomena, their
essential "substratum," the discovery of which man may perhaps
some day reach; and, second, the supposed primary term of each
phenomenal law. But if the world is eternal, this last does not exist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</a></span>
since "the eternity of the substantial involves the eternity of
its effects." Yet, while she attacks Comte's errors in the sphere of
sociology, she renders full justice to his Course of Positive Philosophy,
which was often in advance of its time in respect to the exact
sciences. Among other of Madame Royer's publications we may cite
<i>Zoroastre, son Epoque et sa Doctrine</i> (Zoroaster, his Epoch and his
Doctrine, two volumes, 1875); <i>Les Ages Pr&eacute;historiques</i> (The Prehistoric
Ages, 1876); <i>La Terre et ses Anciens Habitants</i> (The Earth and
its Ancient Inhabitants, 1891), a sort of summary of recent progress
in paleontology, and of facts that may be derived from the study of
living beings; and <i>Les Variations S&eacute;culaires des Saisons</i> (Secular
Variation of the Seasons, 1892), a little work in which the author
endeavors to confirm by observation a theory that climatic variations
are dependent, in the meteorological sense, on planetary movements.
She showed, for example, that in the cold winter of 1879-'80 the
distribution of the planets around the sun was precisely that which
should give the greatest degree of cold for our hemisphere.</p>

<p>We notice also her occasional contributions to different periodicals:
to <i>Le Temps</i>, the <i>Revue des Revues</i>, the <i>Journal des &Eacute;conomistes</i>,
etc. Her last two treatises were published in 1895: <i>La Mati&egrave;re</i>
(or Matter), and <i>L'Inconnaissable</i> (or The Unknowable).</p>

<p>So great intellectual activity has given Madame Royer a first
place among women as students of science. Hence, on March 10,
1897, her numerous admirers and friends offered her a jubilee banquet,
under the chairmanship of M. Levasseur, member of the Institute
of France. The toasts spoken to on this occasion retraced the
brilliant career of the heroine of the feast; and, as the chairman
justly declared, the occasion was "the glorification of woman's knowledge."
Madame Cl&eacute;mence Royer is at present living a very retired
life in the <i>Maison de Retraite</i> founded by the Duchess Galigani at
Neuilly, near Paris, where she enjoys the rest earned by a half century
of persevering labor. Her body is feeble, but her ample brow and
her yet lively eyes seem still to have preserved the recollections of
the struggles of other days.</p>

<h2>Editor's Table.</h2>


<h3><i>WORDS OF A MASTER.</i></h3>

<p>The address, which we print elsewhere,
delivered by Sir Archibald
Geikie to the students of Mason
College, Birmingham, is one to which
we feel it a duty to draw special attention.
It would be difficult, we think,
to state more lucidly than the eminent
author has done the advantages to
be derived from a course of scientific
study, and the principles which must
be kept in view, not only during the
period of study, but through life, if a
training in science is to have its best
results.</p>

<p>The address begins with a few
words of caution as to the drawbacks
which are apt to attend on the exclusive,
or nearly exclusive, pursuit
of science. In the reaction which
the present age has witnessed against
the old literary and linguistic curriculum
of studies, a tendency is manifesting
itself to undervalue the older
learning. This Sir Archibald considers
to be a matter for serious regret.
He recognizes the impossibility
of combining any large amount of
literary or philological study with
the requirements of an extensive scientific
course; but he advises those
who make choice of the latter to
"cherish the literary tastes they
have acquired, and to devote themselves
sedulously to the further cultivation
of them during such intervals
of leisure as they may be able
to secure." A training in science, he
observes, "admirable as it is in many
ways, fails to supply those humanizing
influences which the older learning
can so well impart." Times will
therefore come, even to the most enthusiastic
student, when "scientific
work, in spite of its absorbing interest,
grows to be a weariness"; and
it is then that the value of any literary
culture which may have been
received at school or college will be
appreciated.</p>

<p>It is a quite true remark that
"men who have been too exclusively
trained in science, or are too much
absorbed in its pursuit, are not always
the most agreeable members of
society." It is also true that "one
result of the comparative neglect of
the literary side of education by
many men of science is conspicuously
seen in their literary style,"
which is not infrequently so "slipshod,
ungrammatical, and clumsy
that even the meaning of the authors
is left in doubt." This is a great evil
under the sun: a man goes through
a vast amount of labor to ascertain
facts and discover their meaning;
and when he is ready to transfer the
knowledge that he has gained to
other minds he lacks the skill to do
it in any satisfactory manner. Yet
so far is it from being the case that
there is any necessary incompatibility
between scientific and literary
cultivation, that several of the most
distinguished scientific investigators
have ranked among the best writers
of the day. We need only cite such
names as Sir John Herschel, Lyell,
Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, Clifford,
and Sir Archibald Geikie himself: to
read any of these is a pleasure from
a literary no less than from a scientific
point of view. No very satisfactory
excuse can therefore be made
for those scientific writers who can
not compass a style of reasonable
perspicuity and elegance. We can
only think of them as having fallen
victims to the hurtful error that literary
style is of no advantage to a
scientific man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span></p>

<p>The caution which the address
contains against taking too utilitarian
a view of science is timely and
judicious. We do not believe the
intention of the author is to encourage
the prosecution of alleged scientific
researches independently of
all assignable human motive; but he
would have all the main lines of
scientific inquiry pursued in a liberal
and disinterested spirit, in the belief
that the enlargement of knowledge
can not but subserve in some way or
another, and sooner or later, the interests
of the human race. He feels
that the true scientific spirit is not
one that makes pecuniary gain its
chief object. True types of the scientific
worker are to be found in Michael
Faraday and the elder Agassiz,
who was "too busy to make money";
and the student of science who can
not to some extent work in the spirit
of these men may as well recognize
that it is not scientific truth he is
after but money. The greatest advances
in Science, it is almost needless
to say, have been made by those
who were serving her not for the
lust of gain, but for the love of discovery&mdash;that
is to say, by men like
Copernicus, Galileo, Harvey, Cavendish,
Newton, Franklin, Jenner,
Watt, Darwin, and Pasteur; and if
we would know what science is, it is
the lives, characters, and labors of
such men as these that we should
study, and not the achievements of
merely successful patentees.</p>

<p>Another danger to which the student
of science is exposed is that of
paying little or no attention to any
department of science save that of
which he is making a specialty. It
is therefore of great importance that
the courses of study laid out in science
colleges should at the outset be
sufficiently broad to afford a thorough
grounding in the leading principles
of all the sciences and in the
application of scientific method to
every field of inquiry. Only in this
way can a true sense of the power
and universality of science as a
method of thought and an engine of
the human mind be obtained. Why
is it that we are often so little impressed
with the intellectual character
of this or that noted specialist?
The reason, we take it, is that his
mind lacks breadth; he knows his
own field of observation, but seems
to have little sense or appreciation of
what lies beyond it. It may have
been some one of this type who suggested
to Wordsworth his idea of an
"ever-dwindling soul"; certain it is
that a man may, by the too exclusive
pursuit of a narrow line of thought
and inquiry, fatally cramp his mind
and dim his spiritual vision.</p>

<p>The foundation of all science is
observation, and Sir Archibald rightly
dwells upon the supreme importance
of cultivating and developing
the observing faculty to the utmost
extent. He states that a man may
possess a colossal intellect while his
faculty of observation may be of the
feeblest kind, and gives as an example
a very eminent mathematician,
lately deceased, who used to make
the most ludicrous mistakes as to
time and place. Upon this point we
feel like venturing a little dissent.
We doubt whether there ever was a
colossal intellect apart from a considerable
development of the power
of observation; and that a great
mathematician should take very little
notice of what was going on in the
world about him would only show
that his powers of observation were
otherwise engaged. Take him in his
own field, and what a multitude of
things he would observe which a
man of inferior intellect, occupied
with the same studies, would overlook!
It would be a somewhat rash
thing to undertake to cure an Archimedes
or a Newton of that absent-mindedness
which, to the world at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span>
large, looks like a deficiency of observation.
In such cases as these
the mind that is absent here is present
elsewhere; and what it is doing
there the world will in due time find
out. It is impossible, we hold, for
any one man to be observant in all
directions; if he is, it is certain he
will not have a colossal intellect.
Still, the truth which should be borne
in upon every student's mind is that
if he would make independent progress
he must be an independent observer.
He must take in once for all
the truth that the materials needed
for scientific construction lie afield,
and that he must keep his eyes open
in order to see and distinguish them.
At every moment the man of science
may say, "There are more things in
heaven and earth than are dreamt
of" in any philosophy yet formulated;
and some of those things he
should aim at discovering for himself.
Any mind that is once thoroughly
interested in any branch of
study will be observant, and conversely
a certain practice in observation
may create an interest not before
felt in a certain department of
study. It may also be remarked that
the dividing line between observation
and deduction is very narrow
and more or less shadowy; and therefore
to cultivate the logical faculty
is to create an appetite for observations,
or at least for facts. The logical
mind sees where facts are <i>wanting</i>,
and will not be happy till it gets
them.</p>

<p>As might be expected, Sir Archibald
Geikie makes a special application
of what he has to say on the
need of observation to his own science
of geology&mdash;a study which is a
constant challenge to the observing
eye and the constructive intellect.
He dwells impressively on the delight
which the rational contemplation
of Nature imparts to the student
whose higher faculties have
been awakened, and who has been
taught what to see and how to consider
it. "The movements of the
clouds, the fall of rain, the flow of
brook and river, the changes of the
seasons, the succession of calm and
storm, do not pass before your eyes
now as once they did. While they
minister to the joy of life, they speak
to you of that all-embracing system
of process and law that governs the
world." Certainly this capacity for
the higher enjoyment of Nature is
the happiest result of scientific culture;
and were it an invariable or
even a very general result, there could
never be any question as to the humanizing
and liberalizing effect of
devotion to scientific studies. If the
result in question is not always attained,
it is simply because the study
of science has not been approached
in a right spirit. It is not science
that is at fault.</p>

<p>Sir Archibald dwells finally on
the need for <i>accuracy</i>, <i>thoroughness</i>,
<i>breadth</i>, and <i>patience</i> on the part of
those who would worthily pursue a
scientific career. If his words were
duly heeded we should have more of
generous co-operation and sympathy
among scientific investigators, and
less of selfish petty rivalry and
clamorous contention in regard to
questions of priority. The eminent
author has nobly conceived the character
and function of the man of
science in the present age; and we
can not but hope that his sage and
earnest counsels to the rising generation
of scientific workers will bear
abundant fruit in days to come.</p>


<h3><i>FADS AND FRAUDS.</i></h3>

<p>We notice that a magistrate in
a Canadian city has inflicted fines,
under a "vagrant" act, upon two
individuals who had been practicing
the alleged art of palmistry.
Both of these parties were proved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</a></span>
have told fortunes from the hand for
pay; and, though one styled himself
"professor" and the other was a
"madame" and not a common wayside
gypsy, they were both held guilty
of common juggling and were punished
accordingly. The public prosecutor
said that he did not lay any
stress on the fact that pay had been
taken; he asked for a conviction simply
on the ground that fortune-telling
was against the law, and he carried
his point. The judge observed that
similar proceedings might be taken
against young ladies who tell fortunes
at church and charity bazaars;
and the prosecutor admitted that such
was very likely the case. These
young ladies, he said, would have to
look out for themselves.</p>

<p>We must say that this action on
the part of the Canadian authorities
strikes us very favorably, and we
should be greatly pleased if we could
see similar proceedings taken nearer
home. It is a lamentable fact that
hundreds of persons who ought to
know better amuse themselves by
lending their countenance to the
practitioners of all kinds of silly and
dishonest arts, and so far assist them
in practicing their frauds upon a
more ignorant and helpless class.
We are all familiar with the stories
which pass current in private circles
of the extraordinary revelations and
predictions made by ladies and gentlemen
who go off in trances and
see the past and future unrolled
before their upturned eyes with all
the distinctness of an actual panorama.
But there is one thing which
these interesting and highly gifted
individuals do not like, and that is
to get into the courts, or anywhere
where they can be called upon to
give a succinct and definite account of
their doings and pretensions. They
are not ambitious of going into a
trance before the magistrate, and
giving an exhibition of the powers to
which they lay claim in their advertisements,
much as that might be
expected to help their reputation
and their business. For that very
reason it would be an excellent
thing to bring them where the light
of common day could be thrown
upon their performances; and, if
there is no law under which this
could be done, our legislators, who
make so many needless laws, might
very well pass one, the general effect
of which would be to enforce the
responsibility of all persons publicly
pretending to the possession of
any kind of supernatural power. It
would tend to cool the faith of even
the most benighted dupes to see
their favorite seer cutting a foolish
figure before a judge who simply
wanted to know what it really was
for which he charged money. In
the Canadian cases both operators,
when they got into court, showed a
great disposition to minimize their
claims to any power of foretelling
events by palmistry or otherwise,
and so it would be in every similar
case. It is one thing to deal with a
gullible maiden who wants to know
the color of her future husband's
hair, and quite another to converse
with the officers of the law.</p>

<p>Most of the frauds which have
any continued success owe it, in
part at least, to an undue faith in
the personal integrity of the practitioner.
It seems a rude as well as
an unkind thing to suppose that So-and-so,
whose demeanor is so modest
and frank and simple, whose sentiments
are so elevated, whose whole
personality seems calculated to inspire
confidence, is really an outrageous
deceiver. In many cases
people have said in effect that, if they
had to choose between believing a
miracle and doubting the veracity of
this or that engaging individual, they
would believe the miracle. Yet time
and again the engaging individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</a></span>
has been proved to be an impostor,
and the miracle has fallen to the
ground. One of the most remarkable
cases of the kind is furnished by
the history of the Keeley motor, the
absolutely fraudulent character of
which has lately been brought to
light. Keeley professed to transcend
all the known laws of physics and
mechanics, and he talked a jargon
which all acknowledged to be unintelligible,
but the unintelligibility of
which was ascribed by his devotees
to the fact that he was really working
outside of known laws, and could
not be expected to translate his ideas
into the language of everyday science.
In this way what was really
an adjunct to the imposture he was
practicing was counted as a proof of
the truth of his ideas and the reality
of his work. Yet now we know that
the whole business was a matter of
hidden tubes and wires and pulleys
and double axles, one concealed
within the other, with a water motor
hidden under the floor. Thus it was
that the "&aelig;theric vibrations" and
all the other mysterious phenomena
were produced. We remember a
sermon that was preached some years
ago by an earnest divine, who professed
to see in the alleged effects
produced by Keeley an explanation
of the miracle of the casting down
of the walls of Jericho. Keeley
would take his harmonium and, striking
a certain chord, would cause his
motor to revolve. In like manner
Joshua with his trumpets and pitchers
made precisely the kind of noise
required to produce the &aelig;theric vibrations
necessary to level the walls
of the beleaguered city&mdash;a wonderful
case of the most advanced science
coming to the support of a venerable
religious tradition! Unfortunately,
the walls of Jericho must
now be got down in some other way,
since it is proved that when Keeley
worked the harmonium he also
worked the bulb of an air tube
placed under his foot in the floor.
But Keeley was so honest a man, so
devoted to his profound researches,
so true a type of the indomitable
experimenter, that it was impossible
for his friends and admirers to doubt
him, even when he spoke of "the
sympathetic negative attraction of
the triune polar stream."</p>

<p>The lesson of it all is&mdash;investigate!
<i>investigate!</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">INVESTIGATE!</span> The more
honest a man is, the more he will
court investigation. It is to the
credit of humanity perhaps that so
much reliance is placed upon estimates
of personal character in these
extraordinary cases; but where belief
is demanded for anything that
is absolutely beyond comprehension,
character should be put out of court
altogether, and the one question
should be, What are the facts? In
the Keeley case, unfortunately, men
of science as well as others were
among the deluded. They should
have suspected fraud; at least they
should have insisted on making such
investigations as a suspicion of fraud
would have suggested; and, if they
were not allowed to make them,
they should have refused all countenance
to the business. As it is,
many ignorant persons who lost
money through Keeley's imposture
will very properly cast blame on
the presumedly competent mechanicians
and physicists who went
through the form of examining Keeley's
apparatus and afterward spoke,
however guardedly, of his extraordinary
results. As an object lesson
in regard to the need for uncompromising
skepticism when facts
which can not be accounted for on
understood principles are presented
for acceptance, the history of the
Keeley motor should not soon be
forgotten.</p>

<h2>Scientific Literature.</h2>


<h3>SPECIAL BOOKS.</h3>

<p>Professor <i>Bailey</i> shows, in his book on the <i>Evolution of Our Native
Fruits</i>,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> that the value of the native American species has not yet begun
to be adequately estimated, and his narrative carries the conviction that
the possibilities to be realized from their development are totally undreamed
of. De Candolle made the astounding assertion, in his book on
The Origin of Cultivated Plants, that the United States only yields as nutritious
plants worth cultivating the Jerusalem artichoke and the gourds.
"They had a few bulbs and edible berries, but have not tried to cultivate
them, having early received the maize, which was worth far more." "And
yet," Professor Bailey answers, "the American grapes have given rise to
eight hundred domestic varieties, the American plums to more than two
hundred, the raspberries to three hundred, and various other native fruits
have a large progeny." Three motives, the author says, run through his
book: An attempt to expound the progress of evolution in objects which
are familiar and have not yet been greatly modified by man; an effort to
make a simple historical record from unexplored fields; and a desire to
suggest the treasures of experience and narrative which are a part of the
development of agriculture. The studies of which the book is a fruit were
begun more than ten years ago, and were pursued with original sources
where they were accessible, and at the cost of much labor and travel. The
story begins with the grapes. The cultivation of native grapes, which are
singularly abundant and various in the wild condition, began after several
attempts on the large and on the small scale to make foreign grapes profitable
had failed. Nicholas Longworth, of Cincinnati, who did more than
any other one man to promote it, sought for wine grapes. After several
varieties had been tried with more or less success, the Catawba and the
Concord were introduced, and the cultivation was established and became
important, but no longer with wine-making as its chief object. Now we
have a large variety of grapes&mdash;characteristic, finely flavored, and adapted
to numerous uses in wines and desserts. Plums are mentioned in the early
records nearly as frequently as grapes. There are five native types from
which diverse varieties have arisen, the greater part of them of fortuitous
origin. The native cherries have not yet been very hopeful of promise,
except the dwarf species, which seem "destined to play an important part
in the evolution of American fruit." Five types of native apples are
known, from which a number of named and worthy varieties have arisen,
by Nature's propagation, not man's; and the author anticipates great benefits
to be derived from the very gradual and undemonstrative insinuation
of native blood into the domestic sorts. The story of the cultivation of the
raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, strawberries, gooseberries, currants,
and mulberries tells of much patience and skill applied to the production of
results in the benefits of which all may share, and which have undoubtedly
added to the sum of human well-being. There remain still many fruits, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</a></span>
improvement of which has hardly begun, and which offer a promising field
for experiment&mdash;the persimmon, pawpaw, whortleberry, buffalo berry,
barberry, and nuts. The whole history of the improvement of American
fruit is interpreted by Professor Bailey as showing that in nearly every case
the amelioration has come from the force of circumstances, and not from
the choice or design of man, principally because foreign species did not do
well and something adapted to American conditions had to be found. Yet
much skill has been shown in recognizing the good qualities of the native
species, and in giving them conditions favorable to improvement. For the
future the author believes that the best results at the amelioration of any
species are to be expected by working with the highly improved forms
rather than with the original wild stock. We need, he says, a greater
range of variation, more divergent and widely unlike varieties, and more
incidental or minor strains of the most popular and cosmopolitan sorts.
Professor Bailey finds the greatest satisfaction in his book in the record of
the men who have been instrumental in introducing the improved fruits.
No men have been greater benefactors to our country than these, who have
done the equivalent of making two blades of grass grow where only one
grew before, and have added to the healthful sum of pleasure and content.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Professor Darwin truly says, a mathematical argument is, after all,
only organized common sense; but, unfortunately, it is usually in such a
highly organized form as to be beyond the intelligence of the average
reader. In the present volume,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> however, the author has wonderfully
simplified a most intricate and difficult mathematical subject, and really
seems to give some justification for the above generalization.</p>

<p>The first chapter of <i>The Tides</i> is devoted to defining them and describing
methods of observation and study. The curious tidal movements in
lakes, called <i>seiches</i>, which were first systematically studied by Professor
Forel on the Lake of Geneva, are taken up in the second chapter; an
account of Forel's work is given, and the statement made that similar
researches are now under way on other lakes, notably that of Mr. Denison
on Lake Huron in this country. Tides in rivers, including an account of
the curious tidal phenomenon known as a "bore," are next described, the
laws governing their variation and the ways in which they differ from the
tides of the open sea being carefully laid down. A brief historical chapter,
containing some curious extracts from Chinese and Icelandic literature, is
rather instructive anthropologically than tidally. The three following
sections are taken up by a study of tide generating and modifying forces,
and include an interesting account of the experiments made some years
ago by Dr. Darwin and his brother, in an effort to measure tidal forces by
means of the bifilar pendulum, which is now such an important agent in
seismological investigation. Chapters IX and X give an account of the
equilibrium, and the dynamical theories of the tide-generating forces, and
are chiefly accounts of the devices by which mathematicians have endeavored
to bring artificial order out of the actual chaos. The great complexity
of this portion of the subject; the variety of forces operating to produce
the tides, the sun, the moon, the earth's rotation, etc.; and the number of
retarding and confusing elements, friction, interposed land masses, river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span>
currents, air movements, depth of water, etc., render these theories practically
valueless for use in tidal calculations.</p>

<p>In the following section Dr. Draper shows how, by means of Lord Kelvin's
"harmonic analysis," which separates the tide-generating forces of
each kind into a number of ideal components, results of practical value
are obtained. In Chapter XIII a very ingenious instrument for tide prediction
which has been in use for some time by the Indian Government
is described. The recording part of the machine is simply a paper-wound
drum, on which a pencil point makes a graphic record. When the tides of
a given port are desired, it is only necessary to set the instrument according
to the tidal components, obtained by harmonic analysis and the time
chosen for the beginning of the tide table, and then start it at the proper
moment. It takes about four hours to run off the tidal curve for a year.
This curve is then measured, and the year's tide table readily made out.
Dr. Darwin informs us that a very similar instrument is now in course of
construction for the United States Government. The remainder of the
work consists of a more detailed discussion of the various disturbing influences
which interfere with the simplicity of tidal movements&mdash;displacement
of the earth's axis, earthquakes, etc, a long discussion of tidal friction,
a study of the laws of rotating liquid masses, the nebular hypothesis,
and finally a chapter on Saturn's rings. The text in many places will be
found difficult to understand by the general reader, despite the author's
efforts to fully and simply explain every point, and it seems questionable
whether a thorough discussion of tidal phenomena can be made simple
enough for the layman's comprehension. The volume can not be read by
any one, however, without instruction, and is much the best general discussion
of tidal phenomena which we have seen.</p>


<h3>GENERAL NOTICES.</h3>

<p>The <i>Elementary Zo&ouml;logy</i> of <i>Frank E.
Beddard</i><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> contains an account of a few
types selected from the chief groups of the
animal kingdom, followed and accompanied
by a consideration of some of the more general
conclusions of biology. A type system
has to be used, but the author has endeavored
to obviate the great fault of that method&mdash;the
liability of the students conceiving
that the characters of the species selected
for description are distinctive of a wider assemblage
of forms&mdash;by emphasizing here
and there the differences between allied
groups. The question arises whether to begin
with the higher forms and go down to
the lower, which some authorities believe to
be the course easier of comprehension by
the student, or to follow the inverse method.
The author prefers to begin with the lower
forms and gradually work to the higher as
the course having the undoubted advantage
of presenting the facts in a logical sequence.
He accordingly begins with the am&oelig;ba and
proceeds upward. The treatment is simple
and lucid. Novelty has not been sought in
the illustrations, though there are several
new ones, but selections have been made
from the best already drawn.</p>

<p><i>An Introductory Logic</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> grew out of the
lectures of the author, Prof. <i>J. E. Creighton</i>,
to undergraduate classes in Cornell University;
is intended primarily as a text-book
for students, and aims at being both practical
and theoretical. The broad view is
taken in the definition of the subject that
logic is the science of thought, or the science
that investigates the process of thinking;
and the author expresses himself convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span>
that, in spite of some difficulties, formal
logic is one of the most valuable instruments
in modern education for promoting clear
thinking and for developing critical habits
of mind. To doubters of the advisability
of attempting to include a theory of thought
or a philosophy of mind in an elementary
course in logic, Professor Creighton replies
that psychology having differentiated itself
from philosophy and become a "natural"
science, no longer undertakes to describe all
that the mind is and does. "It belongs to
logic to investigate intelligence as a knowing
function, just as it is the task of ethics to
deal with the practical or active mental faculties."
Logic must first be a science before
it can become an art, but it can not be regarded
as an art in the sense that it furnishes
a definite set of rules for thinking
correctly. What it can do is to show the
method by which new truths have been discovered
and the general conditions that must
always be fulfilled in reasoning correctly.
The treatment in the text follows the usual
order, except that the author, keeping clear
of artificial diction, writes in talking English
that is easy to be comprehended.</p>

<p>There are no more vital problems in the
evolution of society than those connected
with the point of view, the outlook, of the
great masses of the "working people."
These people form the backbone, the potential
energy of society; an acquaintance with
their views of ethics and life, and manner of
living, is of the utmost importance, not only
<i>per se</i>, but especially because of the efficient
direction which such a knowledge can give
the attempts at improving these latter, and
through them society at large. Mr. Walter
Wyckoff has, apparently actuated by some
such view as this, in combination perhaps
with a desire for a novel experience, made a
two years' trip across the continent, living
chiefly among the lowest and most improvident
class of manual laborers; making his
own living by their methods, and, by means
of the close contact, studying them from a
vantage point of unusual value. The account
of this expedition<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> is, as it could not fail to
be, no matter who the traveler might have
been, of great interest and value. But in Mr.
Wyckoff's hands the story has an added attraction
through the literary ability of the
author. There is much material of practical
scientific value in the volume; it should
prove especially suggestive and useful to
some of our charity organization workers who
apparently find it so difficult to govern their
work by reason rather than emotion. There
are one or two rather unpleasant lapses, the
most marked of which advertises in a Chicago
police station Mr. Wyckoff's great linguistic
attainments, but the work is generally free
from this sort of weakness, and is on the
whole very well worth reading for instruction
as well as entertainment.</p>

<p>The <i>Manual of Determinative Mineralogy</i>
of Professors <i>George J. Brush</i> and <i>Samuel
L. Penfield</i><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> is intended primarily to be used
in the identification of minerals, and that
purpose has been kept prominently in view.
The present edition is a complete revision of
Professor Brush's original work, the value
of which and the estimation in which it is
held by its constituency are attested by the
fact that fourteen editions of it have been issued
since it first appeared in 1874. A revision
of the parts devoted to blowpipe
analysis and the chemical reactions of the
elements was published in 1896. To the
present edition a chapter is added on the
physical properties of minerals, devoted
chiefly to crystallography, in which the endeavor
has been made to present the subject
as simply as possible. Importance has been
attached to the description of those forms
which are of most frequent occurrence, and
the examples chosen to illustrate the different
systems represent, as a rule, the simple
forms that prevail in specimens of common
minerals, while rare and complex forms are
treated very briefly. The introduction of a
large number of species since 1874 has made
a complete rearrangement necessary in the
analytical tables; and they have been so developed
that tests for characteristic chemical
constituents furnish the chief means of identification.
Stress is laid upon the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span>
of determining the chemical constituents as
a factor in securing accuracy in identification.</p>

<p>Demonstrator <i>G. S. Newth</i> opens his
<i>Manual of Chemical Analysis</i><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> with a protest
against the thought of "doing" analysis
without learning more than the minimum
amount of chemistry, and against teaching
and practicing it in such a manner as to degrade
it to the level "of a purely mechanical
and often unintelligible series of rule-of-thumb
operations." He says he has done
his best to make it "as little of a cram book
as possible," and has endeavored "to teach
analytical chemistry as well as analysis"&mdash;that
is, the theoretical as well as the practical
side of the subject. He begins with emphasizing
the importance of the student
making himself <i>practically</i> familiar with certain
simple operations he will have to perform
constantly, and gives clear, concise definitions
of such terms as filtration, solution,
evaporation, fusion, precipitation, ignition,
etc., which relate to those operations. He
condemns slovenly formulas and mechanical
notes, but commends real notes of the student's
own observations. In his treatment
he excludes merely descriptive details that
have no bearing on analysis; and in quantitative
analysis, prefers describing fully a few
typical methods and processes to covering
much ground slightly.</p>

<p>The Ingersoll Lectureship at Harvard
University is constituted on a legacy by Miss
Caroline H. Ingersoll, carrying out the wishes
of her father, George G. Ingersoll, for the
foundation of an annual lectureship on the
"Immortality of Man," to which no conditions
as to doctrine or method of treatment
are attached. The purpose of the lectures,
or perhaps their operation, as defined by
Prof. <i>William James</i>, is that out of the series
may emerge a collective literature worthy of
the theme. Professor James took as the
special subject of his lecture<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the answer
to two objections to the doctrine of immortality:
first, the absolute dependence of our
spiritual life, as we know it here, on the
brain; and the second relating to "the incredible
and intolerable number of beings
which, with our modern imagination, we
must believe to be immortal, if immortality
be true." To the former objection the author
replies that thought is not a productive
but a permissive or transmissive function of
the brain; when the brain decays, the sphere
of being that supplied the consciousness is
still intact, and the stream still goes on; to
the second, that spiritual being is not as material
being, that each new mind brings "its
own edition of the universe of space" along
with it, that there is no crowding or interference,
and that the supply of individual
life in the universe can never possibly exceed
the demand.</p>

<p>The first number of <i>In Lantern Land</i>, a
monthly journal "devoted to literature, the
fine arts, the play, with some discussion of
passing events," <i>Charles Dexter Allen</i> and
<i>William Newnham Carleton</i>, editors, gives
promise of a literary journal of elevated tone.
It holds its aim to be unprejudiced and independent.
(Published at Hartford, Conn., by
Charles Dexter Allen, for one dollar a year.)</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Henry Carr Pearson</i> presents in his
<i>Greek Prose Composition</i> (American Book
Company, 90 cents) results of his own experience
in the class room. The aim of the
book is to combine study of the essentials of
Greek syntax with practice in translating
connected English into Attic Greek, and to
afford convenient practice in writing Greek
at sight. The work is in three parts: Part
I, containing, in graded lessons, the principal
points of Greek syntax, designed for use at
the beginning of the second year's study of
Greek; Part II, short simple English sentences
modeled after sentences in Xenophon's
Anabasis, for daily use in connection with
reading of the text; and Part III, connected
English prose, graded, also based on the
Anabasis. Review lessons are introduced,
and a Greek-English vocabulary is provided.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>James W. Crook</i>, in the introduction
to his history of the development of <i>German
Wage Theories</i> (Columbia University Studies
in History, Economics, and Public Law), remarks
upon the slowness with which political
economy, and particularly the study of questions
concerning wages, has advanced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</a></span>
Germany. Hardly any original work on
wages is to be found there for half a century
after the publication of Adam Smith's
Wealth of Nations, although numerous text-books
bearing upon the subject were issued&mdash;all
for the most part only summarizing or
slightly modifying the reasonings and conclusions
of the English master. The conditions
of economic life in the two countries
were different, and the "industrial revolution
was slow in developing on the Continent,
and in Germany the old industrial order with
its restrictions and conservative methods
prevailed long after England had replaced
the old with the new." These differences
between the two countries may adequately
account for the great disparity in theoretic
development. And Germany is still largely
dependent upon other countries in its discussions.
In the present work, the chief object
being to discover progress of thought on the
subject, chronology had to be sacrificed, in
some instances, to a logical treatment. Those
writers are grouped who appear to show the
largest number of points of contact, and this
leads to placing all the German writers
treated in two groups, in one of which a real
unity of method and interest prevails, and
Hermann is the most important center, while
the other group includes von Th&uuml;nen, Karl
Marx, and Schulze-Gaevernitz, authors who
do not belong together in the sense that the
others do.</p>

<p>Among the articles in the <i>Columbia University
Bulletin</i> for June, 1898, are those on
the Department of History, the Preparatory
Schools (by G. R. Carpenter), Columbia Non-Graduates
(H. G. Paine), the Teaching of
Anatomy (by George S. Huntington), and the
second of Mr. H. A. Cushing's historical
papers on King's College in the American
Revolution.</p>

<p>The report of <i>Filibert Noth</i>, special
agent of the Division of Forestry, on <i>Forestry
Conditions</i> and <i>Interests of Wisconsin</i>,
and the <i>Third Annual Report of the Chief
Fire Warden of Minnesota, C. C. Andrews</i>,
furnish many facts and suggestions of value
to persons interested in the maintenance and
protection of our forests.</p>

<p>D. Appleton and Company publish as one
of their Home Reading Books <i>The Story of
Rob Roy</i>, by <i>Sir Walter Scott</i>, condensed for
home and school reading by Edith D. Harris.
The editor of the series, Dr. W. T. Harris,
furnishes a preface, pointing out the essential
qualities of Scott's works on which their fame
rests, and analyzing the features of Scottish
and English life of the age to which they
relate and which give these stories of the
border their interest and charm. In explanation
of the plan and reason of the
present condensation, he says that "it has
been found possible to condense the Waverley
novels by omitting all lengthy descriptions
of scenery, historical disquisitions on the
times, and a few passages of dialogue and
monologue that do not contribute directly to
the progress of the story, or throw light
upon the character of the persons who enter
upon the scene. It is believed that by this
method the interest is preserved intact, and
that after a year's interval the story in its
unabridged form may be read with as lively
an interest as the youth will feel in reading
this version." Price, 60 cents.</p>

<p>A paper, <i>Indices Ponderaux de la Crane</i>
(Weight Indexes of the Brain), in the Bulletin
of the Anthropological Society of Paris, comprises
the results of a study of the weight and
capacity of the brain, the weight of the mandible,
and the cranio-mandibular and cranio-cerebral
indices, etc., made upon sixty-four
heads of animals by <i>George Grant McCurdy</i>,
of New Haven, with the collaboration of M.
<i>Nicolas Mohyliansky</i>.</p>

<p>The pamphlet embodying the <i>Proceedings
of the Tenth Annual Session of the Association
of American Anatomists</i>, held at
Cornell University in December, 1897, contains
a portrait and notice, with bibliography
of the late Dr. Harrison Allen, the reports
of the majority and the minority of the committee
on anatomical nomenclature, and seventeen
papers contributed by members of the
association.</p>

<p>The <i>University Geological Survey of
Kansas</i> is conducted under the authority of
the Board of Regents of the State University,
and has issued already several large and
elegant volumes recording the operations and
results of its work. The fourth volume, now
before us, embraces the paleontology of the
Upper Cretaceous, and is by <i>Samuel W.
Williston</i>, paleontologist. Kansas is famous
for its fossils, no equal area in the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span>
States, perhaps, presenting such varied and
remarkable records of this kind. Yet, while
the State has furnished much of interest to
the sciences of geology and paleontology, the
published accounts in these departments are
confined to scattered and abstruse papers
accessible only to the specialist. The present
publication is an effort to put this knowledge,
so far as the particular formation to
which it relates is concerned, within the
reach of students. Professor Williston has
been engaged for twelve years in the study of
the geology and paleontology of the State,
having spent more than three years in field
exploration, and has been eight years collecting
material for his book, enjoying the
advantage of access to the very important
collection of the university. Much of the
information is here published for the first
time. The fossils of the western part of the
State only are described in it, for the sole
reason that more preparatory work has been
done on them in the university in recent
years; but other departments are in preparation
and will appear in due course. The
fossils described are birds, dinosaurs, crocodiles,
mosasaurs, turtles, microscopic organizations,
and invertebrates, all of the Upper
Cretaceous.</p>

<p>In a paper on <i>The Relations of the People
of the United States to the English and the
Germans</i>, read before the Thursday Club of
Chicago, Mr. <i>William Vocke</i> undertakes a
defense of the Germans against a supposition
that they are hostile to the United
States. This is right, if the Germans need
defense, which we doubt; but to give his
thesis the shape of an attack on England, as
is done in the paper, is unnecessary.</p>

<p>The account of the investigations conducted
by Dr. <i>D. N. Bergey</i> under the supervision
of Drs. J. S. Billings and S. Weir
Mitchell, on the <i>Influence upon the Vital Resistance
of Animals to the Micro-organisms
of Disease, brought about by a Long Sojourn
in Impure Atmosphere</i>, already referred to
in the Monthly, is published under the Hodgkins
Fund in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Contributions.</p>

<p>The <i>Report of the United States National
Museum</i> which we are called upon to notice
is for the year 1895, and bears the signature
of <i>G. Brown Goode</i>. It embraces accounts
of the origin and development of the museum,
its organization and scope, and its work in
public education; reviews of the special
topics in its operations for the year; synopses
of the scientific work in various departments;
the administrative reports; appendixes
relating to accessions to the collections,
lectures, meetings, etc.; and a number of
special papers of great value and interest,
including an account of the Kwakiutl Indians,
by Franz Boas; The Graphic Art of the
Eskimos, by W. J. Hoffman; The Geology
and Natural History of Lower California, by
G. P. Merrill; The Tongues of Birds, by F.
A. Lucas; The Ontonagon Copper Bowlder
in the United States Museum, by Charles
Moore; The Antiquity of the Red Race in
America, by Thomas Nilsen; and accounts
of the Mineralogical Collections in the
Museum, by Wirt Tassin, and of the Taxidermical
Methods in the Leyden Museum, Holland,
by Dr. Shufeldt.</p>

<p><i>The Dawn of the Twentieth Century</i> is a
poem, described by the author, <i>Charles P.
Whaley</i>, as his first sermon, dedicated to
rationalism. He describes himself as having
recovered from "a severe attack of orthodoxy,"
which deprived him for the time
of the power of logical reason, and to have
at last discerned a theology, "founded upon
absolute, demonstrable scientific facts,"
which is to prevail in the next century.
His poem presents his view of that theology.</p>

<p>In the September number of the Quarterly
Review, <i>The New World</i>, an article by
Prof. <i>Otto Pfleiderer</i> on Evolution and Theology,
defines the task of Ecclesiastical
Protestantism after having abandoned the
ethical ideals of medi&aelig;val Christianity, as
being "for a still wider development, to
strike off the dogmatic fetters of ecclesiastical
criticism, and to clothe its religious principle
in new forms of thought, which shall
render for our age the same service that the
Greek and Roman dogmas rendered for the
earlier time." In an article on Social and
Individual Evolution, Mr. <i>Henry Jones</i> maintains
that the social tendencies of the present
day point to a limitation of individual
independence and enterprise.</p>

<p>A contribution to the anthropology of
the Jesup North Pacific Expedition, <i>Facial
Paintings of the Indians of Northern British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span>
Columbia</i>, by <i>Franz Boas</i>, forms the first
part of Volume II of the Memoirs of the
American Museum of Natural History. The
Jesup expedition has been organized under
the patronage of Mr. Morris K. Jesup, president
of the museum, and under the direction
of that institution, to study what relations
may exist or may have existed between the
natives of the northwest coasts of America
and the peoples of the neighboring Asiatic
coasts. The general likeness, in the midst
of their special minor diversities, of all the
Indians of the American continent points to
an ultimately common origin for them, while
the differences indicate that this may not
have been precisely identical in time and
place, and seem to have required a very long
time for their development and establishment.
The purpose of the expedition is to
collect all the information that can be obtained
by its method of exploration contributing
to this end. The present contribution
embodies the fruits of a study of the
arts, as applied to facial decoration, of the
Thompson River Indians, the Chilcotin, the
Bella Coola, the Kakiutl, and the Nootka.
This art is almost exclusively based on animal
motives, is highly conventionalized, and
has the unique peculiarity of seeking to fit
the whole figure of the animal to the surface
on which it is applied; whence it presents
some curious effects. In this effort to illustrate
the principles of its conventionalism
Dr. Boas has selected as the most difficult
and complicated surface the human face, of
which he gives in six plates eighty-eight
figures of as many different styles of decoration.</p>

<p><b>Pre-Columbian Musical Instruments in
America.</b>&mdash;In a recent article in the Popular
Science Monthly (November, 1898), entitled
Was Middle America Peopled from Asia? I
insisted that if there had been any invasion,
peaceful or otherwise, sufficient to have
affected even in the slightest degree the arts,
customs, and religious beliefs of middle
America, then, associated with these influences,
we should find traces of Asiatic utensils,
implements, structures, such as sandals,
weapons, pottery, wheels, plows, roofing
tiles, etc.; in other words, just those objects
most intimately associated with man. I especially
considered the absence of stringed
musical instruments and coincided with Dr.
Otis T. Mason in the belief that there was
no evidence of a pre-Columbian stringed
musical device. This question has been
variously discussed and the following references
bear on the subject: A short note in
the American Antiquarian for January, 1897,
by Dr. D. G. Brinton, entitled Native American
Stringed Musical Instruments. The
author frankly admits, however, that the
cases cited may all have been borrowed
from the whites or negroes. Mr. M. H. Saville
in the American Anthropologist for
August, 1897, described A Primitive Maya
Musical Instrument, though he makes no pronounced
statement of its pre-Columbian origin.
Dr. Mason, in the American Anthropologist
for November, 1897, discusses the
question under the title Geographical Distribution
of the Musical Bow, and in this paper
says, "I have come to the conclusion that
stringed musical instruments were not known
to any of the aborigines of the western
hemisphere before Columbus." In my paper
I insisted that "had this simple musical device
been known anciently in this country, it
would have spread so widely that its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</a></span>
pre-Columbian use would have been beyond any
contention." Mr. Saville finally, in the American
Anthropologist for September, 1898,
shows apparently the existence of a pre-Columbian
stringed musical device in a paper
entitled The Musical Bow in Ancient Mexico,
and presents his proof in the form of a reproduction
from an ancient Mexican codex
of an orchestra of six performers. One of
the figures, according to Mr. Saville's interpretation,
is holding a musical bow in his
left hand while with his right hand he is
striking the cord with a forked stick. Claiming
no skill in the interpretation of these
quaint and concentrated Jack-of-heart figures,
I readily yielded to the authority of
Saville in this matter, and so acknowledged
in a footnote in my paper which I was enabled
to insert after the pages were made
up. Within a few days I have received a
letter from Mrs. Zelia Nuttall, the eminent
American paleographist, to whom we are
indebted for the most profound researches
in connection with these ancient codices. In
this letter Mrs. Nuttall refers to Sahagun's
great manuscript, wherein she says: "The
native musical instruments are repeatedly
enumerated. The turtle's shell figures
among them, <i>but there is no trace of a
stringed musical instrument ever having been
known or employed in ancient Mexico</i>." (The
Italics are hers.) Mrs. Nuttall then says
that the object held under the arm of the
musician which has been recognized as a
musical bow is undoubtedly a turtle's shell.
In support of this view she sends me a tracing
of the figure from the original manuscript
which is now in Vienna, in which the entire
object under the arm of the player as well
as the forked stick is colored blue (Fig. 1).
A photograph is also inclosed from another
ancient Mexican manuscript in course of publication
by Mrs. Nuttall. In this (Fig. 2) the
player has the turtle's shell and is pounding
on it with a pronged stick, horn, or branch,
while in the other hand he holds a rattle and
at the same time sings, the notes being
graphically portrayed as they come from his
mouth. It will be observed that it is the
plastron or ventral surface that he is striking,
as shown by the notches in its forward
and hinder edges, though the plates are incorrectly
drawn. In the figure given by Mr.
Saville the player is holding the turtle's
shell in precisely that position that would
enable him to strike the plastron. Even in
Mr. Saville's figure the marginal
plates of the shell are
plainly indicated. By holding
the figure face downward
the shell is thrown in a normal
position with the back
uppermost, and what was
mistaken for the string of
the instrument is the outline
of the back of the turtle
correctly delineated. With
the above figures I give the
outline of the left arm and
body of a friend who posed for me while
holding a large South American turtle under
his arm. I have drawn the plates of the
carapace to more clearly indicate the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</a></span>
of the turtle's shell. In the original
codex, as before remarked, this portion is
colored blue. In this attitude the flat plastron
forms the drumhead, so to speak, the
carapace acting as a resonator. I am sure
that Mr. Saville will agree with me that Mrs.
Nuttall's attribution is the correct one.</p>

<p><b>Rebreathed Air as a Poison.</b>&mdash;The following
extracts are taken from an article by
Dr. John Hartley, in the Lancet: "The fresh-air
treatment of consumption" appears to be
made up of three essential factors: (1) the
discontinuance of the supply of bacilli from
without; (2) the supply of an abundance of
nutritive material to the tissues; and (3) the
supply of an abundance of fresh air uncontaminated
by the products of respiration.
This seems to mean that the tissues, if not too
enfeebled, may be trusted to deal with the
bacilli already present if their metabolism is
kept going at high pressure. Fresh air is now
the "official" remedy in the treatment of tubercle.
Why is it so ignored in the case of
other diseases? Has the pneumonic or bronchitic
no need of special ventilation because
his microbe is of a different breed? The air
was intended not only for phthisical patients
or patients suffering from pneumonia but for
<i>all</i>&mdash;diseased and healthy alike&mdash;and it is
still the natural medium in which the poisonous
products of tissue metabolism excreted
by the lungs are further broken down
and rendered harmless. Dr. A. Ransome
has done great service not only by his onslaught
on "air sewage" but also by his
coinage of the term; for a thoroughly good
opprobrious epithet resembles a good wall-poster
in its power of arresting and enchaining
the attention of the many. It was long
ago pointed out that certain constituents of
expired air are intensely powerful nerve
poisons. These considerations should surely
make us look on rebreathed air and sewer
gas, not as mere carriers of accidental poisons,
such as influenza and pneumonia and
the like, but as <i>poisons per se</i>, and I wish to
be allowed to record a few very imperfect
observations made by myself during some
years past chiefly on the subject of rebreathed
air, with certain inferences which I
think tend, however feebly and imperfectly,
to show that the poisons we expire have <i>per
se</i> very definite effects on tissue metabolism
and need not a mere perfunctory admixture
with fresh air but very large and very continuous
dilution before they are rendered innocuous&mdash;that
is to say, innocuous to <i>all</i>;
for while some persons appear to be almost
immune, others seem intensely susceptible.
The first observation I will allude to was
made in the autumn of 1896, in cool weather.
I had to take a long night journey by rail after
a long and hard day's work. The train
was full and the compartment I entered was
close; so, as I was tired and fagged, I sat in
the corridor by an open window, well rugged
up, throughout the journey. The compartment
was completely shut off from the corridor
by a glass door and windows, through
which I could freely inspect its occupants.
Two remarkably fresh-complexioned, wholesome-looking
young fellows got into the
compartment at York. They formed a remarkable
contrast to the pallid and fagged-looking
travelers already there. The windows
and ventilators were carefully closed,
and the newcomers, with the rest, settled off
to sleep and slept soundly for nearly four
hours, with the exception of a few minutes'
interval at Grantham. When aroused on
nearing London they, like the other occupants
of the compartment, were haggard and
leaden-hued, their fresh color was entirely
gone, and they looked and moved as if exhausted.
I examined my own face in the
lavatory mirror at the beginning and end of
the journey and could see but little alteration
in my color; if anything, it was rather improved
by the end of the journey. The second
case occurred early in 1897. I was
asked to see a woman, aged about forty-eight
years, who had been treated in a neighboring
town for many weeks for bronchitis
and asthma following influenza. She had
relapsed about a week when I first saw her.
She was then sitting up in bed; her face
was leaden-colored, her skin was clammy
and sweating, with a feeble, quick pulse, and
the heart sounds were indistinguishable owing
to wheezing; there was some crepitation
at the bases. The temperature was about
101&deg; F. The weather was cold, but after
wrapping her up, with a hot bottle to her
feet, the window was well opened. Her
color improved in a few minutes and the
sweating ceased soon after. But it and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[Pg 715]</a></span>
blueness returned if the window was shut
for any time. It was directed to be kept
open night and day, and I could see from
my house that this order was carried out.
Although on one night the thermometer
showed 14&deg; F. of frost the chest was clear
of noises and she was convalescent in eight
days. If fresh air needs warming she ought
to have died. Why do most men feel so
tired after an afternoon's work in a crowded
out-patient room? Why is a long journey in a
full railway carriage, even with a comfortable
seat, so exhausting to many people? Personally
an hour or two in a full carriage with
the windows shut will give me numbness in
my feet and legs and knock me up for the
day, while a railway journey in an empty
carriage with open windows does not affect
me at all. But most people will be willing
to admit that any kind of crowd is tiring.
It is to me difficult to resist the impression
than an overdose of waste products, whether
of one's own or other people's, must generally
interfere with the metabolism of nerve
tissue. Women as they grow older are apt
to live much indoors. I believe the fat,
flabby, paunchy woman, whether purple or
pale, with feeble, irritable heart and "inadequate"
kidneys, is usually the victim of rebreathed
air. A "close" room will infallibly
give me an abdominal distention and
borborygmi within half an hour, and I am inclined
to think the purity of the air breathed
by the dyspeptic quite as important as his
regimen or his teeth. It must, I think,
sooner or later be recognized that many of
the increasing ills which it has been the
fashion to charge on the "hurry and brain
fag" incidental to a high state of civilisation
and a large population are in reality due to
the greater contamination of the air we
breathe by the waste products of that population,
and that toxines excreted by the lungs
will in time take high rank among these as
both potent and insidious. If this should
come to pass, the present ideas anent ventilation
must be abandoned as utterly futile,
and the need will be felt, not of letting a
little air in, but of letting waste products
out.</p>

<p><b>The Utilization of Wave Power.</b>&mdash;The
utilization of the energy which goes to waste
in the movement of water, in waves, tides,
and waterfalls, has been a much-studied
problem during recent years. The only one
of these three phenomena which has as yet
been at all extensively commercially harnessed
is the waterfall. There have, however,
been a number of wave and tide motors constructed.
The most recent and perhaps the
most promising of these is the type invented
by Mr. Morley Fletcher, of Westminster, England.
He has made a special study of the
problem of motion of the sea, and has already
successfully constructed a hydraulic pump,
an electric motor, and a self contained siren
buoy in which the energy is obtained entirely
from wave motion. The great possibilities
in this direction for cheap and efficient power
plants have not been appreciated by seacoast
towns, but it is stated in Industries and
Iron, from which we have taken the above
particulars, that Mr. Fletcher is at present
devoting his attention to devising schemes
and designing apparatus for pumping sea water
for shore purposes, ore washing, driving
electric machinery for town lighting and
power plants, buoys for marking harbors
with beacons and fog horns, and the many
other purposes to which such a constant and
inexhaustible source of energy is applicable.</p>

<p><b>Dispersal of Seeds.</b>&mdash;Having described
in the Plant World some of the provisions of
Nature for the dispersal of seeds, Prof. W.
J. Beal adds that these various devices, besides
serving to extend and multiply the species
and promote its plantation on favorable
soil, enable plants to flee from too great
crowding of their own kind and from their
plant rivals and parasites. "The adventurers
among plants often meet with the best
success, not because the seeds are larger or
stronger or better, but because they find for
a time more congenial surroundings. Our
weeds, for instance, are carried for long distances
by man and by him are planted in
new ground that has been well prepared.
Every horticulturist knows that apples
grown in a new country, if suitable for
apples, are fair and healthy, but the scab
and codling moth and bitter rot and bark
louse sooner or later arrive, each to begin
its peculiar mode of warfare." So with
peach trees and plums and their enemies.
The surest way to grow a few cabbages, radishes,
squashes, cucumbers, and potatoes is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[Pg 716]</a></span>
to plant them here and there in good soil at
considerable distances from where any have
heretofore been grown. "For a time enemies
do not find them." Pear trees planted
scatteringly are more likely to remain healthy
than in orchards. "Perhaps one reason
why plants have become extinct or nearly so
is their lack of means of migration. As animals
starve out in certain seasons when food
is scarce, or more likely migrate to regions
which can afford food, so plants desert worn-out
land and seek fresh fields. As animals
retreat to secluded and isolated spots to escape
their enemies, so many plants accomplish
the same thing by finding the best
places with some of their seeds sown in many
regions. Frequent rotations seem to be the
rule for many plants when left to themselves
in a state of nature. Confining to a permanent
spot invites parasites and other enemies
and a depleted soil, while health and vigor
are secured by frequent migrations."</p>

<p><b>Commensals.</b>&mdash;Curious associations are
formed among animals for mutual aid in the
struggle for existence. Some of them are
societies of the same species, like those of
ants and bees; colonies in which many individuals&mdash;as
ascidians and bryozoa&mdash;join into
a single mass and act as one; and associations
of animals of different species constituting
commensalism where both are benefited,
or parasitism, when the advantage
accrues to only one of the parties. The hermit
crab and certain ascidians furnish very
fine examples of commensalism. The hermit
crab is known as an inhabitant of shells
bereft of their proper owners. Some sea
anemones also fasten themselves on shells,
and seem to prefer those which have been
adopted by hermit crabs. The association is
shown by M. Henri Coupan, in <i>La Nature</i>, to
be one of mutual benefit. The actinia defends
the crab and its home against all intruders
by means of its tentacles&mdash;veritable
batteries of prickly stings; while the crab,
with its long claws reaching out to catch
whatever is good to eat, brings food within
reach of the ascidian. Mr. Percival Wright,
having taken the crab from a shell to which
an ascidian had attached itself, found that
the latter abandoned the shell in a short
time. M. L. Faunt reversed the experiment,
taking the ascidian away, when the crab deserted
its quarters, found a shell with the ascidian
on it, and occupied it very quickly.
He further observed the maneuvers executed
by the crab to secure the attachment of an
ascidian to its shell. Sometimes a large ascidian
will wholly cover a shell; or several
smaller ones will spread themselves over the
same shell so as to form a continuous envelope
over it. The ascidians become so attached
to their commensals as to seem unable
to live without them, and even to die
soon after being separated from them.</p>

<p><b>Drift of Ocean Currents.</b>&mdash;Of sixteen hundred
and seventy-five floats bearing requests
to the finder to return them which Prince
Albert of Monaco dropped into the Atlantic
during three research cruises, with a view to
learning something of the movements of surface
currents, two hundred and twenty-six
were returned to him up to the year 1892.
By working the course which each of them
had probably been following, the prince undertook
to draw a definite map of the currents.
As the elements employed were always
numerous for each region, he thinks
his results were near the truth in its general
lines. The floats landed on almost all the
shores of the North Atlantic, from the North
Cape to the south of Morocco, along Central
America, and on the islands of Canaries,
Madeira, Azores, Antilles, Bermudas, Shetland,
Hebrides, Orkneys, and Iceland. None
appeared as far south as the Cape Verde
Islands. The drifts seem to indicate an immense
vortex, beginning toward the Antilles
and Central America with the Gulf Stream
and the equatorial current; passing the Banks
of Newfoundland at a tangent, it turns to
the east, approaches the European coasts,
and runs southward from the English Channel
to Gibraltar, after having sent a branch
running along the coast of Ireland and the
coast of Norway as far as the North Cape.
It then returns to the west, encircling the
Canaries. Its center oscillates somewhere to
the southwest of the Azores. The author's
observations enabled him also to establish a
very good average for the speed at which
these floats traveled in the different sections
of the vortex, and for every twenty-four
hours: Between the Azores, France, Portugal,
and the Canaries, it was 5.18 miles;
from the Canaries to the Antilles, the Bahamas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[Pg 717]</a></span>
and as far as the Bermudas, 10.11
miles; from the Bermudas to the Azores,
6.42 miles. The mean speed for the North
Atlantic was 4.48 miles. The figures are under
rather than above the truth.</p>

<p><b>Winds of the Sahara.</b>&mdash;Some interesting
meteorological observations, made in the Sahara
during eight excursions between 1883
and 1896, have been published by M. F.
Foureau. The most frequent winds are
those from the northwest and the southeast.
Every evening the wind goes down with the
sun, or goes to bed, as the Chaambe express
it; except the northeast wind, which the
Arabs call <i>el chit&acirc;ne</i>, or the devil, because
it blows all night. Another wind, called the
<i>chihithi</i>, has been mentioned by all travelers,
and is the subject of numerous legends. It
is a warm wind from the southwest, charged
with electricity, and often carrying fine sand
and darkening the atmosphere. The compasses
are much disturbed by it, because,
it has been suggested, of a special condition
produced upon thin glass covers by the friction
caused by the rubbing of the fine wind-carried
sand upon them; but it has been observed
that the spare compasses show the
same disturbed condition as soon as they are
taken out of their boxes. The disturbance
ceases when the glasses are moistened, and
does not appear again till they have dried.
Several hailstorms were noticed, the hailstones
being usually about as large as peas,
but larger in the heavier storms. M. Foureau,
not having gone as far as the central
heights, observed no snow in the Sahara, but
was informed that snow falls in the winter on
the tops of the <i>Tassili des Azdjer</i>, about five
thousand feet above the sea. Similar observations
have been made by other travelers,
and falls of temperature to about 21&deg; F. have
been noticed. Very curious mirage phenomena
were sometimes observed. Observations
of fulgurites, or instances in which the sand
had been vitrified by lightning strokes, were
not infrequent.</p>

<p><b>Evolution of Pleasure Gardens.</b>&mdash;A lesson
in the evolution of pleasure resorts is
suggested in a book by Mr. Warwick
Wroth on the London pleasure gardens. The
history of these places has in some cases
a strong family resemblance. They usually
began as tea gardens, with a bowling green,
tea and coffee, hot loaves, and milk "fresh
from the cow," as their chief attractions.
If the business prospered, other amusements
were added, such as music and dancing, with
perhaps the exhibition of a giant or a fat
woman. Equestrian performances were given
in the more important gardens. The manager
of one of them kept on the grounds a
fine collection of rattlesnakes, one having
nineteen rattles and "seven young ones."
"Sixteen hundred visitors were present at
another one day in August, 1744, to hear
honest 'Jo Baker' beat a trevally on his
side-drum as he did before the great Duke
of Marlborough at the bloody battle of Malplaquet.
It was not unusual, moreover, for
the owner of a successful tavern to discover
on his premises a mineral spring, of which a
favorable analysis was easily obtained"&mdash;although
the spring might be really a bad
one. The Spa of Hampstead Wells enjoyed
a delightfully pure and invigorating air on
the open heath, and had a tavern with coffee
rooms, a bowling green, raffling shops, and a
chapel, which offered visitors an advantage
possessed by no other gardens in London, as
a clergyman was always in attendance, and
a couple on presenting a license could be
married at once on the payment of five shillings.
Mr. Wroth suggests that the license
was sometimes dispensed with, and the fee,
moreover, was remitted if the wedded pair
gave a dinner in the gardens.</p>

<p><b>A Library of Astronomical Photographs.</b>&mdash;The
appointment of Mrs. M. P. Fleming as
curator of astronomical photographs in the
Harvard Observatory is noteworthy because
hers is the first woman's name to be placed
along with the officers in the university catalogue.
It is more so as a recognition of
Mrs. Fleming's proved abilities in certain
lines of astronomical work. The astrophotographic
building is not used for the taking
of photographs, but as a peculiar kind of
library where the plates secured by the astronomers
at Cambridge and Arequipa are
preserved, arranged, and catalogued, as is
done with books. The duties of the curator
are like those of a librarian. But instead of
books, of which many copies exist, each of
the treasures in the photographic collection
is unique and can not be duplicated. Prints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[Pg 718]</a></span>
of them on paper are of little scientific value,
because no paper copy can repeat all the
minute accuracy of the original negative on
glass; and prints are not taken from them
for scientific use, but only for illustration.
If one is destroyed it can never be replaced;
and it is impossible to predict what fact one
of them may embody of the greatest importance
to the labors of some future astronomer
desiring to compare the aspect of his special
object of research at his period and ours.
Mrs. Fleming's name is frequently mentioned
in the reports of the observatory, and she
has distinguished herself in several lines of
stellar investigation. She has about a dozen
women assistants, some of whom are computors
of long experience, and some are
known by the discoveries they have made.</p>

<p><b>Forest Planting on the Plains.</b>&mdash;Mr.
Charles A. Keffer, in a report to the Forestry
Division on Experimental Tree Planting
in the Plains, defines the forestless region of
America as including all the States between
the Mississippi River north of the Ozark
Mountains and eastern Texas and the Rocky
Mountains, together with the plateau west of
the Rocky Mountains. The possibilities of
forest growth in this vast area are yet to be
proved. Roughly speaking, any species that
thrive in the adjacent wooded region can be
grown in Iowa, the Red River Valley of Minnesota
and North Dakota, the Sioux Valley
of South Dakota and the eastern counties of
Nebraska, and in the more southern States.
We know that difficulties of cultivation increase
as one goes westward, but we can not
say where the western limit of successful
tree culture is. We can not even define the
limits of successful agriculture in the plains,
for with increased facilities for irrigation
splendid crops are now produced where only
a few years ago it was thought desert conditions
would forever prevail. It is admitted
that forest planting, as a financial investment,
will probably be profitable on the plains only
in a limited degree. Favorable sites may enable
the profitable raising of fence posts and
other specialized tree crops, but the growing
of timber on a commercial scale can hardly be
expected.</p>

<p><b>A Siamese Geological Theory.</b>&mdash;The east
coast of Siam as far south as Champawn is
characterized by wide bays, with detached
masses of limestone set on steep-sided islands
or high-peaked promontories with serrated
ridges, the most conspicuous of which is Sam
Roi Yawt, or the three hundred peaks. The
relations of these various rock masses to one
another, Mr. H. Warington Smyth observed,
in an address to the Royal Geographical Society,
have been long ago lucidly set forth
by Siamese geologists, who are unanimously
agreed on the subject. "It appears that
one Mong Lai and his wife once inhabited
the neighborhood (they were giants), and
each promised their daughter in marriage,
unknown to the other, to a different suitor.
At last the day of the nuptials arrived, and
Chao Lai and the Lord of Mieang Chin
(China) both arrived to claim the bride.
When the horrified father found how matters
stood&mdash;having a regard for the value of
a promise, which is not too common in the
East&mdash;he cut his daughter in half, so that
neither suitor should be disappointed. Chao
Lai, in the meantime, on finding that he had
a rival, committed suicide, and the peak of
Chaolai is the remains of his body. The unfortunate
bride is to be found in the islands
off Sam Roi Yawt, the peaks of which are
the remains of the gifts which were to be
made to the holy man who was to solemnize
the wedding; while Kaw Chang and Kaw
King, on the east side of the gulf, are the
elephant and buffalo cart in which the presents
were brought."</p>

<p><b>"The Hell of War."</b>&mdash;The Cost of a
National Crime and The Hell of War and its
Penalties are the appropriate names which
Edward Atkinson has given to two essays
bearing upon the craze for expansion in
which the nation has been abruptly plunged.
In them an evil which has not yet received
due attention, if any, is presented as sure to
be inflicted upon us if the policy of militarism
is persisted in. "How much increase
of taxation," Mr. Atkinson asks, "are you
willing to bear, and how many of your neighbors'
sons are you ready to sacrifice by fever,
malaria, and venereal disease, in order to extend
the sovereignty of the United States
over the West Indies and the Philippine
Islands?" Another question is put to the
missionary enthusiasts: "It may be well to
ask all who are imbued with this missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[Pg 719]</a></span>
sympathy, How many young men of your
own brotherhood are you willing to sacrifice
for each convert? How many of your own
sons will you expose to sure infection
and degeneration in the conduct of your
philanthropic purpose? Or will you satisfy
your own conscience by consenting to the
necessary conscription of other people's sons
when it presently becomes impossible to
maintain our armed forces in those islands
without a draft?" Mr. Atkinson says that
his attention has been called to this phase
of the evil attendant upon military occupation
in the course of his social studies.
"The greatest and most unavoidable danger,"
he writes to the commander in chief of
our armies, "to which these forces will be
exposed will be neither fevers nor malaria;
it will be venereal diseases in their worst
and most malignant form."</p>


<h3>MINOR PARAGRAPHS.</h3>

<p>A new and very ingenious method of
space telegraphy is discussed at length in an
article by Karl Zickler in the <i>Elektrotechnische
Zeitschrift</i>. It depends on a phenomenon
discovered by Hertz in 1887, viz., the influence
of certain short wave-length light rays
upon electrical discharges. The ultra-violet
waves, which are obstructed by glass but
transmitted by quartz, are the most effective.
The source of light is an arc lamp. The
light is passed through a lens of rock crystal
to the receiver. The receiver is a glass vessel
partially exhausted of air, one end of
which consists of a truly parallel plate of
rock crystal. In front of the receiver there
is a condensing lens of rock crystal, and
within the exhausted chamber are the two
electrodes, one of which is an inclined disk
and the other a small ball. The electrodes
are connected with the secondary portion of
an induction coil, and when the ultra-violet
rays fall upon the inclined disk and are reflected
to the ball, a discharge will be produced
which may be read either with a telephone
or a coherer. The signals are sent by
alternately interposing a plate of glass in
front of the rays issuing from the transmitter
and removing it therefrom. Herr Zickler
has made many experiments to verify his
conclusions and appears to have demonstrated
the feasibility of his idea in practice.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawson Williams has announced in
Nature the discovery in many susceptible
persons of a periodicity in the effects that
follow a sting. The immediate result, he
says, is a small flattened wheal, pale and
surrounded by a zone of pink injection.
This is attended by itching, but both wheal
and itching are gone in less than an hour.
About twenty-four hours later the part begins
to itch again, and in a few minutes a
hard, rounded, deep-red papule appears, and
is quickly surrounded by an area of &oelig;dematous
skin. The formication is intense, and
in the affected area, while the ordinary sensations
of touch are dulled, those of temperature
and painful feelings are exaggerated.
In two or three hours the itching diminishes
and the &oelig;dema disappears, leaving a small,
red papule, which itches but little. The
phenomena recur, with diminished intensity,
in the course of another twenty-four hours,
and may return in this way, growing fainter
all the time, in four or five daily repetitions.
After these returns have ceased, a small,
indolent papule may persist for weeks or
months. This periodicity is not observed in
all subjects, but most generally in those who
suffer most.</p>

<p>Among the advantages of Linde's liquid-air
process, Prof. J. A. Ewing, speaking at
the English Society of Arts, claimed its giving
a means of separating more or less completely
the oxygen of the atmosphere from
its associated nitrogen. After describing a
process by which a liquid consisting largely
of oxygen may be produced, the author said
that the most interesting application of the
liquid which had hitherto been tried on a
commercial scale was to make an explosive
by mixing it with carbon. When liquid air,
enriched by the evaporation of a large part
of the nitrogen, was mixed with powdered
charcoal, it formed an explosive comparable
in power to dynamite, and which, like dynamite,
could be made to go off violently by
using a detonator. The chief advantage of
the explosive was its cheapness, the cost being
only that of liquefying the air. Even
the fact that after a short time the mixture
ceased to be capable of exploding might be
urged as a recommendation, for if a detonator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[Pg 720]</a></span>
hung fire, there was no danger of the
charge going off accidentally some time after
the explosion was due, nor was there any
risk of its being purloined or used for criminal
purposes.</p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>According to the <i>Tribune de Gen&egrave;ve</i>,
twenty new hotels were opened in Switzerland
in 1897, and twenty-five were enlarged,
adding two thousand beds and making the
whole number of beds about ninety thousand.
The number of nights' lodgings furnished
during the season is estimated at ten million.
Supposing each guest to spend twelve francs
a day, the total revenue from tourists would
amount to one hundred and twenty million
francs, or twenty four million dollars. Classifying
the guests according to nationality, it is
estimated that the Swiss constitute eighteen
per cent of the whole, Germans thirty-four
per cent, English sixteen per cent, French
twelve per cent, Americans eight per cent,
and those of other nations twelve per cent.</p>

<p>A list of women astronomers, compiled
by Herman S. Davis from Ribiere's <i>Les
Femmes dans la Science</i>, contains as contemporary
workers in the science the names
of seventeen American women who have
taken part in astronomical computations or
are teachers of astronomy, and twelve who
are working in the application of photography
to astronomy. Of the women in the
later list, Miss Ida C. Martin, Miss Dr. Dorothea
Klumpke (now in the Paris Observatory),
and Mrs. M. P. Fleming have attained distinction
for successful original researches.</p>

<p>The object of the Pure Food and Drug
Congress, which met in Washington in March,
1898, with Joseph E. Blackburn, of Columbus,
Ohio, as president, is declared in its
resolutions to be to secure suitable national
legislation to prevent the adulteration of
food, drink, and drugs, to secure the enforcement
of laws, and secure and promote uniformity
of State legislation looking to that
end; to create and maintain a high public
sentiment on these subjects, to sustain public
officers enforcing the laws respecting them;
and to promote a more general intelligence
concerning the injury to health and business
interests resulting from food adulteration.
In this work all are invited to join. The
congress was in session four days, and several
important papers were read to it.</p>

<p>The large Atlantic coastal plain beginning
with southern New Jersey, Mr. John
Gifford affirms, in The Forester, would soon
be capable, if protected from reckless devastation,
of producing almost limitless quantities
of the valuable smooth-bark or short leaf
pine. In Northampton and Accomac Counties,
Virginia, lying in this plain, the forests
are already properly cared for and propagated
without the aid of forest laws. This is
done by insuring their freedom from fire,
which is attended to purely as a matter of
present economy. The value of the woods in
holding the loose sandy soil and as windbreaks
is recognized, and the litter of the
pine trees is a precious dressing for the
sweet potato fields. This litter, of pine
"chats," "needles," or "browse," is carefully
raked off every year and spread on the
fields, and there is nothing left in which fire
can start.</p>

<p>The Lalande prize of the French Academy
of Sciences has been conferred upon
Prof. S. C. Chandler, of Cambridge, Mass.,
in recognition of "the splendor, the importance,
and the variety" of his astronomical
work; the Damoiseau prize upon Dr. George
William Hill, of Washington, for his researches
in mathematics and astronomy;
and the Henry Wilde prize on Dr. Charles
A. Schott, of Washington, for his researches
in terrestrial magnetism.</p>

<p>Prof. J. Mark Baldwin, of Princeton,
author of the books The Development of
the Child and the Race, Handbook of Psychology,
and The Story of the Mind, has
been elected a member of the French Institute
of Sociology.</p>

<p>Among the recent deaths of men associated
with scientific pursuits we notice
those of Charles Michel Brisse, professor at
the Lyc&eacute;e Condorcet for twenty-five years,
and professor at other French schools, author
of papers on the displacement of figures and
on the general theory of surfaces, and of
other works in mathematics and mathematical

professor of history at Algiers and at Paris. He took the direction of the <i>Revue independante</i>
in 1847; founded with Lamennais the journal <i>Le Peuple constituant</i>, and was an
ardent promoter of the Revolution of 1848. Having became a member of the National
Assembly, he opposed the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte. Being obliged in consequence
of this act to exile himself, he retired to Belgium and afterward to Lausanne.
He did not return to France till after the war of 1870, and died in August, 1885. The
most interesting of his works is the Historical Essay on the Races of Africa (<i>Essai historique
sur les Races de l'Afrique</i>, 1845).</p></div>
